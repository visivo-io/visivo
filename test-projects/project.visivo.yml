# V2 Spec

name: V2

# Strings can be "evaluate" in several ways:
# 1. They are a reference to another object, a "ref"
#    1. I propose we drop this and simply use the name.  Because it can be an object or a name simple
# 2. They are a reference to the output of our "query"
# 3. They are a bash script, like in script model
# 4. They are a python like in tests
# 5. We also can have jinja templates
