A value of 1 (default) gives a head about 3x as wide as the line. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of annotation arrow line. </li> <li>Sets the x component of the arrow tail about the arrow head. If <code>axref</code> is <code>pixel</code>, a positive (negative) component corresponds to an arrow pointing from right to left (left to right). If <code>axref</code> is not <code>pixel</code> and is exactly the same as <code>xref</code>, this is an absolute value on that axis, like <code>x</code>, specified in the same coordinates as <code>xref</code>. </li> <li>Indicates in what coordinates the tail of the annotation (ax,ay) is specified. If set to a x axis id (e.g. \"x\" or \"x2\"), the <code>x</code> position refers to a x coordinate. If set to \"paper\", the <code>x</code> position refers to the distance from the left of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where \"0\" (\"1\") corresponds to the left (right). If set to a x axis ID followed by \"domain\" (separated by a space), the position behaves like for \"paper\", but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the left of the domain of that axis: e.g., \"x2 domain\" refers to the domain of the second x axis and a x position of 0.5 refers to the point between the left and the right of the domain of the second x axis. In order for absolute positioning of the arrow to work, \"axref\" must be exactly the same as \"xref\", otherwise \"axref\" will revert to \"pixel\" (explained next). For relative positioning, \"axref\" can be set to \"pixel\", in which case the \"ax\" value is specified in pixels relative to \"x\". Absolute positioning is useful for trendline annotations which should continue to indicate the correct trend when zoomed. Relative positioning is useful for specifying the text offset for an annotated point. </li> <li>Sets the y component of the arrow tail about the arrow head. If <code>ayref</code> is <code>pixel</code>, a positive (negative) component corresponds to an arrow pointing from bottom to top (top to bottom). If <code>ayref</code> is not <code>pixel</code> and is exactly the same as <code>yref</code>, this is an absolute value on that axis, like <code>y</code>, specified in the same coordinates as <code>yref</code>. </li> <li>Indicates in what coordinates the tail of the annotation (ax,ay) is specified. If set to a y axis id (e.g. \"y\" or \"y2\"), the <code>y</code> position refers to a y coordinate. If set to \"paper\", the <code>y</code> position refers to the distance from the bottom of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where \"0\" (\"1\") corresponds to the bottom (top). If set to a y axis ID followed by \"domain\" (separated by a space), the position behaves like for \"paper\", but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the domain of that axis: e.g., \"y2 domain\" refers to the domain of the second y axis and a y position of 0.5 refers to the point between the bottom and the top of the domain of the second y axis.

By default <code>captureevents</code> is \"false\" unless <code>hovertext</code> is provided. If you use the event <code>plotly_clickannotation</code> without <code>hovertext</code> you must explicitly enable <code>captureevents</code>. </li> <li>Makes this annotation respond to clicks on the plot. If you click a data point that exactly matches the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values of this annotation, and it is hidden (visible: false), it will appear. In \"onoff\" mode, you must click the same point again to make it disappear, so if you click multiple points, you can show multiple annotations. In \"onout\" mode, a click anywhere else in the plot (on another data point or not) will hide this annotation. If you need to show/hide this annotation in response to different <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> values, you can set <code>xclick</code> and/or <code>yclick</code>. This is useful for example to label the side of a bar. To label markers though, <code>standoff</code> is preferred over <code>xclick</code> and <code>yclick</code>. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

If omitted or blank, no hover label will appear. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it).

If \"true\", <code>text</code> is placed near the arrow's tail. If \"false\", <code>text</code> lines up with the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> provided. </li> <li>Sets a distance, in pixels, to move the end arrowhead away from the position it is pointing at, for example to point at the edge of a marker independent of zoom. Note that this shortens the arrow from the <code>ax</code> / <code>ay</code> vector, in contrast to <code>xshift</code> / <code>yshift</code> which moves everything by this amount. </li> <li>Sets the start annotation arrow head style. </li> <li>Sets the size of the start annotation arrow head, relative to <code>arrowwidth</code>.

Has an effect only if an explicit height is set to override the text height. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this annotation is visible. </li> <li>to start a new line. </li> <li>Sets the annotation's x position. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears. </li> <li>Sets the text box's horizontal position anchor This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the annotation. For example, if <code>x</code> is set to 1, <code>xref</code> to \"paper\" and <code>xanchor</code> to \"right\" then the right-most portion of the annotation lines up with the right-most edge of the plotting area. If \"auto\", the anchor is equivalent to \"center\" for data-referenced annotations or if there is an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the closest side. </li> <li>Toggle this annotation when clicking a data point whose <code>x</code> value is <code>xclick</code> rather than the annotation's <code>x</code> value. </li> <li>Sets the annotation's x coordinate axis. If set to a x axis id (e.g. \"x\" or \"x2\"), the <code>x</code> position refers to a x coordinate. If set to \"paper\", the <code>x</code> position refers to the distance from the left of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where \"0\" (\"1\") corresponds to the left (right). If set to a x axis ID followed by \"domain\" (separated by a space), the position behaves like for \"paper\", but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the left of the domain of that axis: e.g., \"x2 domain\" refers to the domain of the second x axis and a x position of 0.5 refers to the point between the left and the right of the domain of the second x axis. </li> <li>Shifts the position of the whole annotation and arrow to the right (positive) or left (negative) by this many pixels. </li> <li>Sets the annotation's y position. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears. </li> <li>Sets the text box's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the annotation. For example, if <code>y</code> is set to 1, <code>yref</code> to \"paper\" and <code>yanchor</code> to \"top\" then the top-most portion of the annotation lines up with the top-most edge of the plotting area. If \"auto\", the anchor is equivalent to \"middle\" for data-referenced annotations or if there is an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the closest side. </li> <li>Toggle this annotation when clicking a data point whose <code>y</code> value is <code>yclick</code> rather than the annotation's <code>y</code> value. </li> <li>Sets the annotation's y coordinate axis. If set to a y axis id (e.g. \"y\" or \"y2\"), the <code>y</code> position refers to a y coordinate. If set to \"paper\", the <code>y</code> position refers to the distance from the bottom of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where \"0\" (\"1\") corresponds to the bottom (top). If set to a y axis ID followed by \"domain\" (separated by a space), the position behaves like for \"paper\", but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the domain of that axis: e.g., \"y2 domain\" refers to the domain of the second y axis and a y position of 0.5 refers to the point between the bottom and the top of the domain of the second y axis. </li> <li>Shifts the position of the whole annotation and arrow up (positive) or down (negative) by this many pixels. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a layout width or height that has been left undefined by the user is initialized on each relayout. Note that, regardless of this attribute, an undefined layout width or height is always initialized on the first call to plot. </li> <li>Using \"strict\" a numeric string in trace data is not converted to a number. Using \"convert types\" a numeric string in trace data may be treated as a number during automatic axis <code>type</code> detection. This is the default value; however it could be overridden for individual axes. </li> <li>Sets the default calendar system to use for interpreting and displaying dates throughout the plot. </li> <li>Determines the mode of single click interactions. \"event\" is the default value and emits the <code>plotly_click</code> event. In addition this mode emits the <code>plotly_selected</code> event in drag modes \"lasso\" and \"select\", but with no event data attached (kept for compatibility reasons). The \"select\" flag enables selecting single data points via click. This mode also supports persistent selections, meaning that pressing Shift while clicking, adds to / subtracts from an existing selection. \"select\" with <code>hovermode</code>: \"x\" can be confusing, consider explicitly setting <code>hovermode</code>: \"closest\" when using this feature. Selection events are sent accordingly as long as \"event\" flag is set as well. When the \"event\" flag is missing, <code>plotly_click</code> and <code>plotly_selected</code> events are not fired. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>colorscale</code>. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here corresponding trace color array(s)) or the bounds set in <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code> Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as corresponding trace color array(s) and if set, <code>cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>cmin</code> and/or <code>cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as corresponding trace color array(s). Has no effect when <code>cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as corresponding trace color array(s) and if set, <code>cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction).

Using \"convert types\" a numeric string in trace data may be treated as a number during automatic axis <code>type</code> detection. Defaults to layout.autotypenumbers. </li> <li>Sets the order in which categories on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>categoryorder</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>categoryorder</code>. </li> <li>Specifies the ordering logic for the case of categorical variables. By default, plotly uses \"trace\", which specifies the order that is present in the data supplied. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"category ascending\" or \"category descending\" if order should be determined by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"array\" to derive the ordering from the attribute <code>categoryarray</code>. If a category is not found in the <code>categoryarray</code> array, the sorting behavior for that attribute will be identical to the \"trace\" mode. The unspecified categories will follow the categories in <code>categoryarray</code>. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"total ascending\" or \"total descending\" if order should be determined by the numerical order of the values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the min, max, sum, mean or median of all the values. </li> <li>Sets default for all colors associated with this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid color is lightened by blending this with the plot background Individual pieces can override this. </li> <li>Sets the direction corresponding to positive angles. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the color of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If \"above traces\", this axis is displayed above all the subplot's traces If \"below traces\", this axis is displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like traces with <code>cliponaxis</code> set to \"false\" to show markers and/or text nodes above this axis. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Set the angular period. Has an effect only when <code>angularaxis.type</code> is \"category\". </li> <li>Sets that start position (in degrees) of the angular axis By default, polar subplots with <code>direction</code> set to \"counterclockwise\" get a <code>rotation</code> of \"0\" which corresponds to due East (like what mathematicians prefer). In turn, polar with <code>direction</code> set to \"clockwise\" get a rotation of \"90\" which corresponds to due North (like on a compass), </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If \"true\", the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is drawn. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the format unit of the formatted \"theta\" values. Has an effect only when <code>angularaxis.type</code> is \"linear\". </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python.

If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>Sets the angular axis type. If \"linear\", set <code>thetaunit</code> to determine the unit in which axis value are shown.

Has an effect only when the angular axis has <code>type</code> \"category\". Note that <code>radialaxis.angle</code> is snapped to the angle of the closest vertex when <code>gridshape</code> is \"circular\" (so that radial axis scale is the same as the data scale). </li> <li>Sets the fraction of the radius to cut out of the polar subplot. </li> <li>Sets the angle (in degrees) from which the radial axis is drawn. Note that by default, radial axis line on the theta=0 line corresponds to a line pointing right (like what mathematicians prefer). Defaults to the first <code>polar.sector</code> angle. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the range of this axis is computed in relation to the input data. See <code>rangemode</code> for more info. If <code>range</code> is provided, then <code>autorange</code> is set to \"false\". </li> <li>Using \"strict\" a numeric string in trace data is not converted to a number. Using \"convert types\" a numeric string in trace data may be treated as a number during automatic axis <code>type</code> detection.

For example, if <code>x</code> is set to 1, <code>xref</code> to \"paper\" and <code>xanchor</code> to \"right\" then the right-most portion of the annotation lines up with the right-most edge of the plotting area. If \"auto\", the anchor is equivalent to \"center\" for data-referenced annotations or if there is an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the closest side. </li> <li>Shifts the position of the whole annotation and arrow to the right (positive) or left (negative) by this many pixels. </li> <li>Sets the annotation's y position. </li> <li>Sets the text box's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the annotation. For example, if <code>y</code> is set to 1, <code>yref</code> to \"paper\" and <code>yanchor</code> to \"top\" then the top-most portion of the annotation lines up with the top-most edge of the plotting area. If \"auto\", the anchor is equivalent to \"middle\" for data-referenced annotations or if there is an arrow, whereas for paper-referenced with no arrow, the anchor picked corresponds to the closest side. </li> <li>Shifts the position of the whole annotation and arrow up (positive) or down (negative) by this many pixels. </li> <li>Sets the annotation's z position. </li> <li>If \"cube\", this scene's axes are drawn as a cube, regardless of the axes' ranges. If \"data\", this scene's axes are drawn in proportion with the axes' ranges. If \"manual\", this scene's axes are drawn in proportion with the input of \"aspectratio\" (the default behavior if \"aspectratio\" is provided). If \"auto\", this scene's axes are drawn using the results of \"data\" except when one axis is more than four times the size of the two others, where in that case the results of \"cube\" are used. </li> <li>Sets the projection type.

Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the range of this axis is computed in relation to the input data. See <code>rangemode</code> for more info. If <code>range</code> is provided, then <code>autorange</code> is set to \"false\". </li> <li>Using \"strict\" a numeric string in trace data is not converted to a number. Using \"convert types\" a numeric string in trace data may be treated as a number during automatic axis <code>type</code> detection. Defaults to layout.autotypenumbers. </li> <li>Sets the background color of this axis' wall. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use for <code>range</code> and <code>tick0</code> if this is a date axis. This does not set the calendar for interpreting data on this axis, that's specified in the trace or via the global <code>layout.calendar</code> </li> <li>Sets the order in which categories on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>categoryorder</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>categoryorder</code>. </li> <li>Specifies the ordering logic for the case of categorical variables. By default, plotly uses \"trace\", which specifies the order that is present in the data supplied. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"category ascending\" or \"category descending\" if order should be determined by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"array\" to derive the ordering from the attribute <code>categoryarray</code>. If a category is not found in the <code>categoryarray</code> array, the sorting behavior for that attribute will be identical to the \"trace\" mode. The unspecified categories will follow the categories in <code>categoryarray</code>. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"total ascending\" or \"total descending\" if order should be determined by the numerical order of the values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the min, max, sum, mean or median of all the values. </li> <li>Sets default for all colors associated with this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid color is lightened by blending this with the plot background Individual pieces can override this. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the color of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored to the opposite side of the plotting area. If \"true\", the axis lines are mirrored. If \"ticks\", the axis lines and ticks are mirrored. If \"false\", mirroring is disable. If \"all\", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes subplots. If \"allticks\", axis lines and ticks are mirrored on all shared-axes subplots. </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the range of this axis. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range from 0 to 2). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears. </li> <li>If \"normal\", the range is computed in relation to the extrema of the input data. If \"tozero\"`, the range extends to 0, regardless of the input data If \"nonnegative\", the range is non-negative, regardless of the input data. Applies only to linear axes. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>Sets whether or not this axis is labeled </li> <li>Sets whether or not this axis' wall has a background color. </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If \"true\", the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is drawn. </li> <li>Sets whether or not spikes starting from data points to this axis' wall are shown on hover. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the color of the spikes. </li> <li>Sets whether or not spikes extending from the projection data points to this axis' wall boundaries are shown on hover. </li> <li>Sets the thickness (in px) of the spikes. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info).

Only has an effect if <code>categoryorder</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>categoryorder</code>. </li> <li>Specifies the ordering logic for the case of categorical variables. By default, plotly uses \"trace\", which specifies the order that is present in the data supplied. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"category ascending\" or \"category descending\" if order should be determined by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"array\" to derive the ordering from the attribute <code>categoryarray</code>. If a category is not found in the <code>categoryarray</code> array, the sorting behavior for that attribute will be identical to the \"trace\" mode. The unspecified categories will follow the categories in <code>categoryarray</code>. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"total ascending\" or \"total descending\" if order should be determined by the numerical order of the values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the min, max, sum, mean or median of all the values. </li> <li>Sets default for all colors associated with this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid color is lightened by blending this with the plot background Individual pieces can override this. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the color of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored to the opposite side of the plotting area. If \"true\", the axis lines are mirrored. If \"ticks\", the axis lines and ticks are mirrored. If \"false\", mirroring is disable. If \"all\", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes subplots. If \"allticks\", axis lines and ticks are mirrored on all shared-axes subplots. </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the range of this axis. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range from 0 to 2). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears. </li> <li>If \"normal\", the range is computed in relation to the extrema of the input data. If \"tozero\"`, the range extends to 0, regardless of the input data If \"nonnegative\", the range is non-negative, regardless of the input data. Applies only to linear axes. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>Sets whether or not this axis is labeled </li> <li>Sets whether or not this axis' wall has a background color. </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If \"true\", the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is drawn. </li> <li>Sets whether or not spikes starting from data points to this axis' wall are shown on hover. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the color of the spikes. </li> <li>Sets whether or not spikes extending from the projection data points to this axis' wall boundaries are shown on hover. </li> <li>Sets the thickness (in px) of the spikes. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported.

If set to a y axis id (e.g. \"y\" or \"y2\"), the <code>y</code> position refers to a y coordinate. If set to \"paper\", the <code>y</code> position refers to the distance from the bottom of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where \"0\" (\"1\") corresponds to the bottom (top). If set to a y axis ID followed by \"domain\" (separated by a space), the position behaves like for \"paper\", but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the domain of that axis: e.g., \"y2 domain\" refers to the domain of the second y axis and a y position of 0.5 refers to the point between the bottom and the top of the domain of the second y axis. </li> <li>Sets the decimal and thousand separators. For example, \". \" puts a '.' before decimals and a space between thousands. In English locales, dflt is \".,\" but other locales may alter this default. </li> <li>Determines whether the shape could be activated for edit or not. Has no effect when the older editable shapes mode is enabled via <code>config.editable</code> or <code>config.edits.shapePosition</code>. </li> <li>Sets the color filling the shape's interior. Only applies to closed shapes. </li> <li>Determines which regions of complex paths constitute the interior. For more info please visit https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/fill-rule </li> <li>Specifies whether shapes are drawn below or above traces. </li> <li>Sets the line color. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Sets the line width (in px). </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the shape. </li> <li>For <code>type</code> \"path\" - a valid SVG path with the pixel values replaced by data values in <code>xsizemode</code>/<code>ysizemode</code> being \"scaled\" and taken unmodified as pixels relative to <code>xanchor</code> and <code>yanchor</code> in case of \"pixel\" size mode. There are a few restrictions / quirks only absolute instructions, not relative. So the allowed segments are: M, L, H, V, Q, C, T, S, and Z arcs (A) are not allowed because radius rx and ry are relative. In the future we could consider supporting relative commands, but we would have to decide on how to handle date and log axes. Note that even as is, Q and C Bezier paths that are smooth on linear axes may not be smooth on log, and vice versa. no chained \"polybezier\" commands - specify the segment type for each one. On category axes, values are numbers scaled to the serial numbers of categories because using the categories themselves there would be no way to describe fractional positions On data axes: because space and T are both normal components of path strings, we can't use either to separate date from time parts. Therefore we'll use underscore for this purpose: 2015-02-21_13:45:56.789 </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>Specifies the shape type to be drawn. If \"line\", a line is drawn from (<code>x0</code>,<code>y0</code>) to (<code>x1</code>,<code>y1</code>) with respect to the axes' sizing mode. If \"circle\", a circle is drawn from ((<code>x0</code>+<code>x1</code>)/2, (<code>y0</code>+<code>y1</code>)/2)) with radius (|(<code>x0</code>+<code>x1</code>)/2 - <code>x0</code>|, |(<code>y0</code>+<code>y1</code>)/2 -<code>y0</code>)|) with respect to the axes' sizing mode. If \"rect\", a rectangle is drawn linking (<code>x0</code>,<code>y0</code>), (<code>x1</code>,<code>y0</code>), (<code>x1</code>,<code>y1</code>), (<code>x0</code>,<code>y1</code>), (<code>x0</code>,<code>y0</code>) with respect to the axes' sizing mode. If \"path\", draw a custom SVG path using <code>path</code>. with respect to the axes' sizing mode. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this shape is visible. </li> <li>Sets the shape's starting x position. See <code>type</code> and <code>xsizemode</code> for more info. </li> <li>Sets the shape's end x position. See <code>type</code> and <code>xsizemode</code> for more info. </li> <li>Only relevant in conjunction with <code>xsizemode</code> set to \"pixel\". Specifies the anchor point on the x axis to which <code>x0</code>, <code>x1</code> and x coordinates within <code>path</code> are relative to. E.g. useful to attach a pixel sized shape to a certain data value. No effect when <code>xsizemode</code> not set to \"pixel\". </li> <li>Sets the shape's x coordinate axis. If set to a x axis id (e.g. \"x\" or \"x2\"), the <code>x</code> position refers to a x coordinate. If set to \"paper\", the <code>x</code> position refers to the distance from the left of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where \"0\" (\"1\") corresponds to the left (right). If set to a x axis ID followed by \"domain\" (separated by a space), the position behaves like for \"paper\", but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the left of the domain of that axis: e.g., \"x2 domain\" refers to the domain of the second x axis and a x position of 0.5 refers to the point between the left and the right of the domain of the second x axis. </li> <li>Sets the shapes's sizing mode along the x axis. If set to \"scaled\", <code>x0</code>, <code>x1</code> and x coordinates within <code>path</code> refer to data values on the x axis or a fraction of the plot area's width (<code>xref</code> set to \"paper\"). If set to \"pixel\", <code>xanchor</code> specifies the x position in terms of data or plot fraction but <code>x0</code>, <code>x1</code> and x coordinates within <code>path</code> are pixels relative to <code>xanchor</code>. This way, the shape can have a fixed width while maintaining a position relative to data or plot fraction. </li> <li>Sets the shape's starting y position. See <code>type</code> and <code>ysizemode</code> for more info. </li> <li>Sets the shape's end y position. See <code>type</code> and <code>ysizemode</code> for more info. </li> <li>Only relevant in conjunction with <code>ysizemode</code> set to \"pixel\". Specifies the anchor point on the y axis to which <code>y0</code>, <code>y1</code> and y coordinates within <code>path</code> are relative to. E.g. useful to attach a pixel sized shape to a certain data value. No effect when <code>ysizemode</code> not set to \"pixel\". </li> <li>Sets the shape's y coordinate axis. If set to a y axis id (e.g. \"y\" or \"y2\"), the <code>y</code> position refers to a y coordinate. If set to \"paper\", the <code>y</code> position refers to the distance from the bottom of the plotting area in normalized coordinates where \"0\" (\"1\") corresponds to the bottom (top). If set to a y axis ID followed by \"domain\" (separated by a space), the position behaves like for \"paper\", but refers to the distance in fractions of the domain length from the bottom of the domain of that axis: e.g., \"y2 domain\" refers to the domain of the second y axis and a y position of 0.5 refers to the point between the bottom and the top of the domain of the second y axis. </li> <li>Sets the shapes's sizing mode along the y axis. If set to \"scaled\", <code>y0</code>, <code>y1</code> and y coordinates within <code>path</code> refer to data values on the y axis or a fraction of the plot area's height (<code>yref</code> set to \"paper\"). If set to \"pixel\", <code>yanchor</code> specifies the y position in terms of data or plot fraction but <code>y0</code>, <code>y1</code> and y coordinates within <code>path</code> are pixels relative to <code>yanchor</code>. This way, the shape can have a fixed height while maintaining a position relative to data or plot fraction. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a legend is drawn. Default is <code>true</code> if there is a trace to show and any of these: a) Two or more traces would by default be shown in the legend. b) One pie trace is shown in the legend. c) One trace is explicitly given with <code>showlegend: true</code>. </li> <li>Determines which button (by index starting from 0) is considered active. </li> <li>Sets the background color of the slider grip while dragging. </li> <li>Sets the background color of the slider. </li> <li>Sets the color of the border enclosing the slider. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the border enclosing the slider. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

That is, the slider's length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this slider length is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the length in pixels of minor step tick marks </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array.

When false, all other behaviors are the same and command execution is skipped. This may be useful when hooking into, for example, the <code>plotly_sliderchange</code> method and executing the API command manually without losing the benefit of the slider automatically binding to the state of the plot through the specification of <code>method</code> and <code>args</code>. </li> <li>Sets the text label to appear on the slider </li> <li>Sets the Plotly method to be called when the slider value is changed. If the <code>skip</code> method is used, the API slider will function as normal but will perform no API calls and will not bind automatically to state updates.

As with hoverdistance, distance does not apply to area-like objects. In addition, some objects can be hovered on but will not generate spikelines, such as scatter fills. </li> <li>Default attributes to be applied to the plot. Templates can be created from existing plots using <code>Plotly.makeTemplate</code>, or created manually. They should be objects with format: <code>{layout: layoutTemplate, data: {[type]: [traceTemplate, ...]}, ...}</code> <code>layoutTemplate</code> and <code>traceTemplate</code> are objects matching the attribute structure of <code>layout</code> and a data trace. Trace templates are applied cyclically to traces of each type. Container arrays (eg <code>annotations</code>) have special handling: An object ending in <code>defaults</code> (eg <code>annotationdefaults</code>) is applied to each array item. But if an item has a <code>templateitemname</code> key we look in the template array for an item with matching <code>name</code> and apply that instead. If no matching <code>name</code> is found we mark the item invisible. Any named template item not referenced is appended to the end of the array, so you can use this for a watermark annotation or a logo image, for example. To omit one of these items on the plot, make an item with matching <code>templateitemname</code> and <code>visible: false</code>. </li> <li>Sets default for all colors associated with this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid color is lightened by blending this with the plot background Individual pieces can override this. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the color of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If \"above traces\", this axis is displayed above all the subplot's traces If \"below traces\", this axis is displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like traces with <code>cliponaxis</code> set to \"false\" to show markers and/or text nodes above this axis. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>The minimum value visible on this axis. The maximum is determined by the sum minus the minimum values of the other two axes.

Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\".

Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>The amount of padding (in px) along the bottom of the component. </li> <li>The amount of padding (in px) on the left side of the component. </li> <li>The amount of padding (in px) on the right side of the component. </li> <li>The amount of padding (in px) along the top of the component. </li> <li>Sets the plot's title. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position with respect to <code>xref</code> in normalized coordinates from \"0\" (left) to \"1\" (right). </li> <li>Sets the title's horizontal alignment with respect to its x position. \"left\" means that the title starts at x, \"right\" means that the title ends at x and \"center\" means that the title's center is at x. \"auto\" divides <code>xref</code> by three and calculates the <code>xanchor</code> value automatically based on the value of <code>x</code>. </li> <li>Sets the container <code>x</code> refers to. \"container\" spans the entire <code>width</code> of the plot. \"paper\" refers to the width of the plotting area only. </li> <li>Sets the y position with respect to <code>yref</code> in normalized coordinates from \"0\" (bottom) to \"1\" (top). \"auto\" places the baseline of the title onto the vertical center of the top margin. </li> <li>Sets the title's vertical alignment with respect to its y position. \"top\" means that the title's cap line is at y, \"bottom\" means that the title's baseline is at y and \"middle\" means that the title's midline is at y. \"auto\" divides <code>yref</code> by three and calculates the <code>yanchor</code> value automatically based on the value of <code>y</code>. </li> <li>Sets the container <code>y</code> refers to. \"container\" spans the entire <code>height</code> of the plot. \"paper\" refers to the height of the plotting area only. </li> <li>The duration of the transition, in milliseconds. If equal to zero, updates are synchronous. </li> <li>The easing function used for the transition </li> <li>Determines whether the figure's layout or traces smoothly transitions during updates that make both traces and layout change. </li> <li>Used to allow user interactions with the plot to persist after <code>Plotly.react</code> calls that are unaware of these interactions. If <code>uirevision</code> is omitted, or if it is given and it changed from the previous <code>Plotly.react</code> call, the exact new figure is used. If <code>uirevision</code> is truthy and did NOT change, any attribute that has been affected by user interactions and did not receive a different value in the new figure will keep the interaction value. <code>layout.uirevision</code> attribute serves as the default for <code>uirevision</code> attributes in various sub-containers. For finer control you can set these sub-attributes directly. For example, if your app separately controls the data on the x and y axes you might set <code>xaxis.uirevision=\"time\"</code> and <code>yaxis.uirevision=\"cost\"</code>. Then if only the y data is changed, you can update <code>yaxis.uirevision=\"quantity\"</code> and the y axis range will reset but the x axis range will retain any user-driven zoom. </li> <li>Sets the minimum text size between traces of the same type. </li> <li>Determines how the font size for various text elements are uniformed between each trace type. If the computed text sizes were smaller than the minimum size defined by <code>uniformtext.minsize</code> using \"hide\" option hides the text; and using \"show\" option shows the text without further downscaling. Please note that if the size defined by <code>minsize</code> is greater than the font size defined by trace, then the <code>minsize</code> is used. </li> <li>Determines which button (by index starting from 0) is considered active. </li> <li>Sets the background color of the update menu buttons. </li> <li>Sets the color of the border enclosing the update menu. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the border enclosing the update menu. </li> <li>Sets a 2nd set of <code>args</code>, these arguments values are passed to the Plotly method set in <code>method</code> when clicking this button while in the active state. Use this to create toggle buttons. </li> <li>Sets the arguments values to be passed to the Plotly method set in <code>method</code> on click. </li> <li>When true, the API method is executed. When false, all other behaviors are the same and command execution is skipped. This may be useful when hooking into, for example, the <code>plotly_buttonclicked</code> method and executing the API command manually without losing the benefit of the updatemenu automatically binding to the state of the plot through the specification of <code>method</code> and <code>args</code>. </li> <li>Sets the text label to appear on the button. </li> <li>Sets the Plotly method to be called on click. If the <code>skip</code> method is used, the API updatemenu will function as normal but will perform no API calls and will not bind automatically to state updates. This may be used to create a component interface and attach to updatemenu events manually via JavaScript. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this button is visible. </li> <li>Determines the direction in which the buttons are laid out, whether in a dropdown menu or a row/column of buttons. For <code>left</code> and <code>up</code>, the buttons will still appear in left-to-right or top-to-bottom order respectively. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>Determines whether the buttons are accessible via a dropdown menu or whether the buttons are stacked horizontally or vertically </li> <li>Determines whether or not the update menu is visible. </li> <li>Sets the x position (in normalized coordinates) of the update menu. </li> <li>Sets the update menu's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the range selector. </li> <li>Sets the y position (in normalized coordinates) of the update menu. </li> <li>Sets the update menu's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the range selector. </li> <li>Sets the plot's width (in px). </li> <li>If set to an opposite-letter axis id (e.g. <code>x2</code>, <code>y</code>), this axis is bound to the corresponding opposite-letter axis. If set to \"free\", this axis' position is determined by <code>position</code>. </li> <li>Determines whether long tick labels automatically grow the figure margins. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the range of this axis is computed in relation to the input data. See <code>rangemode</code> for more info. If <code>range</code> is provided, then <code>autorange</code> is set to \"false\". </li> <li>Using \"strict\" a numeric string in trace data is not converted to a number. Using \"convert types\" a numeric string in trace data may be treated as a number during automatic axis <code>type</code> detection. Defaults to layout.autotypenumbers. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use for <code>range</code> and <code>tick0</code> if this is a date axis. This does not set the calendar for interpreting data on this axis, that's specified in the trace or via the global <code>layout.calendar</code> </li> <li>Sets the order in which categories on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>categoryorder</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>categoryorder</code>. </li> <li>Specifies the ordering logic for the case of categorical variables. By default, plotly uses \"trace\", which specifies the order that is present in the data supplied. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"category ascending\" or \"category descending\" if order should be determined by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"array\" to derive the ordering from the attribute <code>categoryarray</code>. If a category is not found in the <code>categoryarray</code> array, the sorting behavior for that attribute will be identical to the \"trace\" mode. The unspecified categories will follow the categories in <code>categoryarray</code>. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"total ascending\" or \"total descending\" if order should be determined by the numerical order of the values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the min, max, sum, mean or median of all the values. </li> <li>Sets default for all colors associated with this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid color is lightened by blending this with the plot background Individual pieces can override this. </li> <li>If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its own <code>scaleanchor</code> and <code>scaleratio</code> or those of the other axis), determines how that happens: by increasing the \"range\", or by decreasing the \"domain\". Default is \"domain\" for axes containing image traces, \"range\" otherwise. </li> <li>If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its own <code>scaleanchor</code> and <code>scaleratio</code> or those of the other axis), determines which direction we push the originally specified plot area. Options are \"left\", \"center\" (default), and \"right\" for x axes, and \"top\", \"middle\" (default), and \"bottom\" for y axes. </li> <li>Sets the color of the dividers Only has an effect on \"multicategory\" axes. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the dividers Only has an effect on \"multicategory\" axes. </li> <li>Sets the domain of this axis (in plot fraction). </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-able. If true, then zoom is disabled. </li> <li>Sets the color of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If \"above traces\", this axis is displayed above all the subplot's traces If \"below traces\", this axis is displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like traces with <code>cliponaxis</code> set to \"false\" to show markers and/or text nodes above this axis. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If set to another axis id (e.g. <code>x2</code>, <code>y</code>), the range of this axis will match the range of the corresponding axis in data-coordinates space. Moreover, matching axes share auto-range values, category lists and histogram auto-bins. Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a <code>scaleanchor</code> and a <code>matches</code> constraint is currently forbidden. Moreover, note that matching axes must have the same <code>type</code>. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\".

To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Sets the color of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines. </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If \"true\", the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored to the opposite side of the plotting area. If \"true\", the axis lines are mirrored. If \"ticks\", the axis lines and ticks are mirrored. If \"false\", mirroring is disable. If \"all\", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes subplots. If \"allticks\", axis lines and ticks are mirrored on all shared-axes subplots. </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>If set a same-letter axis id, this axis is overlaid on top of the corresponding same-letter axis, with traces and axes visible for both axes. If \"false\", this axis does not overlay any same-letter axes. In this case, for axes with overlapping domains only the highest-numbered axis will be visible. </li> <li>Sets the position of this axis in the plotting space (in normalized coordinates). Only has an effect if <code>anchor</code> is set to \"free\". </li> <li>Sets the range of this axis. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range from 0 to 2). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears. </li> <li>Sets the lower and upper bounds of this axis rangebreak. Can be used with <code>pattern</code>. </li> <li>Sets the size of each <code>values</code> item. The default is one day in milliseconds. </li> <li>Determines whether this axis rangebreak is enabled or disabled. Please note that <code>rangebreaks</code> only work for \"date\" axis type. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Determines a pattern on the time line that generates breaks. If \"day of week\" - days of the week in English e.g. 'Sunday' or <code>sun</code> (matching is case-insensitive and considers only the first three characters), as well as Sunday-based integers between 0 and 6. If \"hour\" - hour (24-hour clock) as decimal numbers between 0 and 24. for more info. Examples: - { pattern: 'day of week', bounds: [6, 1] } or simply { bounds: ['sat', 'mon'] } breaks from Saturday to Monday (i.e. skips the weekends). - { pattern: 'hour', bounds: [17, 8] } breaks from 5pm to 8am (i.e. skips non-work hours). </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>Sets the coordinate values corresponding to the rangebreaks. An alternative to <code>bounds</code>. Use <code>dvalue</code> to set the size of the values along the axis. </li> <li>If \"normal\", the range is computed in relation to the extrema of the input data. If \"tozero\"`, the range extends to 0, regardless of the input data If \"nonnegative\", the range is non-negative, regardless of the input data. Applies only to linear axes. </li> <li>Sets the background color of the active range selector button. </li> <li>Sets the background color of the range selector buttons. </li> <li>Sets the color of the border enclosing the range selector. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the border enclosing the range selector. </li> <li>Sets the number of steps to take to update the range. Use with <code>step</code> to specify the update interval. </li> <li>Sets the text label to appear on the button. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>The unit of measurement that the <code>count</code> value will set the range by. </li> <li>Sets the range update mode. If \"backward\", the range update shifts the start of range back \"count\" times \"step\" milliseconds. If \"todate\", the range update shifts the start of range back to the first timestamp from \"count\" times \"step\" milliseconds back. For example, with <code>step</code> set to \"year\" and <code>count</code> set to \"1\" the range update shifts the start of the range back to January 01 of the current year. Month and year \"todate\" are currently available only for the built-in (Gregorian) calendar. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this button is visible. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines whether or not this range selector is visible. Note that range selectors are only available for x axes of <code>type</code> set to or auto-typed to \"date\". </li> <li>Sets the x position (in normalized coordinates) of the range selector. </li> <li>Sets the range selector's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the range selector. </li> <li>Sets the y position (in normalized coordinates) of the range selector. </li> <li>Sets the range selector's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the range selector. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the range slider range is computed in relation to the input data. If <code>range</code> is provided, then <code>autorange</code> is set to \"false\". </li> <li>Sets the background color of the range slider. </li> <li>Sets the border color of the range slider. </li> <li>Sets the border width of the range slider. </li> <li>Sets the range of the range slider. If not set, defaults to the full xaxis range. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears. </li> <li>The height of the range slider as a fraction of the total plot area height. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the range slider will be visible. If visible, perpendicular axes will be set to <code>fixedrange</code> </li> <li>Sets the range of this axis for the rangeslider. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the range of this axis in the rangeslider use the same value than in the main plot when zooming in/out. If \"auto\", the autorange will be used. If \"fixed\", the <code>range</code> is used. If \"match\", the current range of the corresponding y-axis on the main subplot is used. </li> <li>If set to another axis id (e.g. <code>x2</code>, <code>y</code>), the range of this axis changes together with the range of the corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. <code>constrain</code> and <code>constraintoward</code> determine how we enforce the constraint. You can chain these, ie <code>yaxis: {scaleanchor: \"x\"}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: \"y\"}</code> but you can only link axes of the same <code>type</code>. The linked axis can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across subplots). Loops (<code>yaxis: {scaleanchor: \"x\"}, xaxis: {scaleanchor: \"y\"}</code> or longer) are redundant and the last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid possible inconsistent constraints via <code>scaleratio</code>. Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a <code>scaleanchor</code> and a <code>matches</code> constraint is currently forbidden. </li> <li>If this axis is linked to another by <code>scaleanchor</code>, this determines the pixel to unit scale ratio. For example, if this value is 10, then every unit on this axis spans 10 times the number of pixels as a unit on the linked axis. Use this for example to create an elevation profile where the vertical scale is exaggerated a fixed amount with respect to the horizontal. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>Determines whether or not a dividers are drawn between the category levels of this axis. Only has an effect on \"multicategory\" axes. </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If \"true\", the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is drawn. </li> <li>Determines whether or not spikes (aka droplines) are drawn for this axis. Note: This only takes affect when hovermode = closest </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Determines whether a x (y) axis is positioned at the \"bottom\" (\"left\") or \"top\" (\"right\") of the plotting area. </li> <li>Sets the spike color. If undefined, will use the series color </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Determines the drawing mode for the spike line If \"toaxis\", the line is drawn from the data point to the axis the series is plotted on. If \"across\", the line is drawn across the entire plot area, and supersedes \"toaxis\". If \"marker\", then a marker dot is drawn on the axis the series is plotted on </li> <li>Determines whether spikelines are stuck to the cursor or to the closest datapoints. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the zero line. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to their corresponding ticks and grid lines. Only has an effect for axes of <code>type</code> \"date\" When set to \"period\", tick labels are drawn in the middle of the period between ticks. </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". Otherwise on \"category\" and \"multicategory\" axes the default is \"allow\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to the axis Please note that top or bottom has no effect on x axes or when <code>ticklabelmode</code> is set to \"period\". Similarly left or right has no effect on y axes or when <code>ticklabelmode</code> is set to \"period\". Has no effect on \"multicategory\" axes or when <code>tickson</code> is set to \"boundaries\". When used on axes linked by <code>matches</code> or <code>scaleanchor</code>, no extra padding for inside labels would be added by autorange, so that the scales could match. </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Determines where ticks and grid lines are drawn with respect to their corresponding tick labels. Only has an effect for axes of <code>type</code> \"category\" or \"multicategory\". When set to \"boundaries\", ticks and grid lines are drawn half a category to the left/bottom of labels. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the standoff distance (in px) between the axis labels and the title text The default value is a function of the axis tick labels, the title <code>font.size</code> and the axis <code>linewidth</code>. Note that the axis title position is always constrained within the margins, so the actual standoff distance is always less than the set or default value. By setting <code>standoff</code> and turning on <code>automargin</code>, plotly.js will push the margins to fit the axis title at given standoff distance. </li> <li>Sets the title of this axis. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to determined the axis type by looking into the data of the traces that referenced the axis in question. </li> <li>Controls persistence of user-driven changes in axis <code>range</code>, <code>autorange</code>, and <code>title</code> if in <code>editable: true</code> configuration. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. </li> <li>A single toggle to hide the axis while preserving interaction like dragging. Default is true when a cheater plot is present on the axis, otherwise false </li> <li>Determines whether or not a line is drawn at along the 0 value of this axis. If \"true\", the zero line is drawn on top of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the line color of the zero line. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the zero line. </li> <li>If set to an opposite-letter axis id (e.g. <code>x2</code>, <code>y</code>), this axis is bound to the corresponding opposite-letter axis. If set to \"free\", this axis' position is determined by <code>position</code>. </li> <li>Determines whether long tick labels automatically grow the figure margins. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the range of this axis is computed in relation to the input data. See <code>rangemode</code> for more info. If <code>range</code> is provided, then <code>autorange</code> is set to \"false\". </li> <li>Using \"strict\" a numeric string in trace data is not converted to a number. Using \"convert types\" a numeric string in trace data may be treated as a number during automatic axis <code>type</code> detection. Defaults to layout.autotypenumbers. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use for <code>range</code> and <code>tick0</code> if this is a date axis. This does not set the calendar for interpreting data on this axis, that's specified in the trace or via the global <code>layout.calendar</code> </li> <li>Sets the order in which categories on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>categoryorder</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>categoryorder</code>. </li> <li>Specifies the ordering logic for the case of categorical variables. By default, plotly uses \"trace\", which specifies the order that is present in the data supplied. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"category ascending\" or \"category descending\" if order should be determined by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"array\" to derive the ordering from the attribute <code>categoryarray</code>. If a category is not found in the <code>categoryarray</code> array, the sorting behavior for that attribute will be identical to the \"trace\" mode. The unspecified categories will follow the categories in <code>categoryarray</code>. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"total ascending\" or \"total descending\" if order should be determined by the numerical order of the values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the min, max, sum, mean or median of all the values. </li> <li>Sets default for all colors associated with this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid color is lightened by blending this with the plot background Individual pieces can override this. </li> <li>If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its own <code>scaleanchor</code> and <code>scaleratio</code> or those of the other axis), determines how that happens: by increasing the \"range\", or by decreasing the \"domain\". Default is \"domain\" for axes containing image traces, \"range\" otherwise. </li> <li>If this axis needs to be compressed (either due to its own <code>scaleanchor</code> and <code>scaleratio</code> or those of the other axis), determines which direction we push the originally specified plot area. Options are \"left\", \"center\" (default), and \"right\" for x axes, and \"top\", \"middle\" (default), and \"bottom\" for y axes. </li> <li>Sets the color of the dividers Only has an effect on \"multicategory\" axes. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the dividers Only has an effect on \"multicategory\" axes. </li> <li>Sets the domain of this axis (in plot fraction). </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this axis is zoom-able. If true, then zoom is disabled. </li> <li>Sets the color of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If \"above traces\", this axis is displayed above all the subplot's traces If \"below traces\", this axis is displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like traces with <code>cliponaxis</code> set to \"false\" to show markers and/or text nodes above this axis. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If set to another axis id (e.g. <code>x2</code>, <code>y</code>), the range of this axis will match the range of the corresponding axis in data-coordinates space. Moreover, matching axes share auto-range values, category lists and histogram auto-bins. Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a <code>scaleanchor</code> and a <code>matches</code> constraint is currently forbidden. Moreover, note that matching axes must have the same <code>type</code>. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position).

To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Sets the color of the grid lines. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines. </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If \"true\", the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>Determines if the axis lines or/and ticks are mirrored to the opposite side of the plotting area. If \"true\", the axis lines are mirrored. If \"ticks\", the axis lines and ticks are mirrored. If \"false\", mirroring is disable. If \"all\", axis lines are mirrored on all shared-axes subplots. If \"allticks\", axis lines and ticks are mirrored on all shared-axes subplots. </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>If set a same-letter axis id, this axis is overlaid on top of the corresponding same-letter axis, with traces and axes visible for both axes. If \"false\", this axis does not overlay any same-letter axes. In this case, for axes with overlapping domains only the highest-numbered axis will be visible. </li> <li>Sets the position of this axis in the plotting space (in normalized coordinates). Only has an effect if <code>anchor</code> is set to \"free\". </li> <li>Sets the range of this axis. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range from 0 to 2). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears. </li> <li>Sets the lower and upper bounds of this axis rangebreak. Can be used with <code>pattern</code>. </li> <li>Sets the size of each <code>values</code> item. The default is one day in milliseconds. </li> <li>Determines whether this axis rangebreak is enabled or disabled. Please note that <code>rangebreaks</code> only work for \"date\" axis type. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Determines a pattern on the time line that generates breaks. If \"day of week\" - days of the week in English e.g. 'Sunday' or <code>sun</code> (matching is case-insensitive and considers only the first three characters), as well as Sunday-based integers between 0 and 6. If \"hour\" - hour (24-hour clock) as decimal numbers between 0 and 24. for more info. Examples: - { pattern: 'day of week', bounds: [6, 1] } or simply { bounds: ['sat', 'mon'] } breaks from Saturday to Monday (i.e. skips the weekends). - { pattern: 'hour', bounds: [17, 8] } breaks from 5pm to 8am (i.e. skips non-work hours). </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>Sets the coordinate values corresponding to the rangebreaks. An alternative to <code>bounds</code>. Use <code>dvalue</code> to set the size of the values along the axis. </li> <li>If \"normal\", the range is computed in relation to the extrema of the input data. If \"tozero\"`, the range extends to 0, regardless of the input data If \"nonnegative\", the range is non-negative, regardless of the input data. Applies only to linear axes. </li> <li>If set to another axis id (e.g. <code>x2</code>, <code>y</code>), the range of this axis changes together with the range of the corresponding axis such that the scale of pixels per unit is in a constant ratio. Both axes are still zoomable, but when you zoom one, the other will zoom the same amount, keeping a fixed midpoint. <code>constrain</code> and <code>constraintoward</code> determine how we enforce the constraint. You can chain these, ie <code>yaxis: {scaleanchor: \"x\"}, xaxis2: {scaleanchor: \"y\"}</code> but you can only link axes of the same <code>type</code>. The linked axis can have the opposite letter (to constrain the aspect ratio) or the same letter (to match scales across subplots). Loops (<code>yaxis: {scaleanchor: \"x\"}, xaxis: {scaleanchor: \"y\"}</code> or longer) are redundant and the last constraint encountered will be ignored to avoid possible inconsistent constraints via <code>scaleratio</code>. Note that setting axes simultaneously in both a <code>scaleanchor</code> and a <code>matches</code> constraint is currently forbidden. </li> <li>If this axis is linked to another by <code>scaleanchor</code>, this determines the pixel to unit scale ratio. For example, if this value is 10, then every unit on this axis spans 10 times the number of pixels as a unit on the linked axis. Use this for example to create an elevation profile where the vertical scale is exaggerated a fixed amount with respect to the horizontal. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>Determines whether or not a dividers are drawn between the category levels of this axis. Only has an effect on \"multicategory\" axes. </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If \"true\", the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is drawn. </li> <li>Determines whether or not spikes (aka droplines) are drawn for this axis. Note: This only takes affect when hovermode = closest </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Determines whether a x (y) axis is positioned at the \"bottom\" (\"left\") or \"top\" (\"right\") of the plotting area. </li> <li>Sets the spike color. If undefined, will use the series color </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Determines the drawing mode for the spike line If \"toaxis\", the line is drawn from the data point to the axis the series is plotted on. If \"across\", the line is drawn across the entire plot area, and supersedes \"toaxis\".

Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to their corresponding ticks and grid lines. Only has an effect for axes of <code>type</code> \"date\" When set to \"period\", tick labels are drawn in the middle of the period between ticks. </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". Otherwise on \"category\" and \"multicategory\" axes the default is \"allow\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn with respect to the axis Please note that top or bottom has no effect on x axes or when <code>ticklabelmode</code> is set to \"period\". Similarly left or right has no effect on y axes or when <code>ticklabelmode</code> is set to \"period\". Has no effect on \"multicategory\" axes or when <code>tickson</code> is set to \"boundaries\". When used on axes linked by <code>matches</code> or <code>scaleanchor</code>, no extra padding for inside labels would be added by autorange, so that the scales could match. </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Determines where ticks and grid lines are drawn with respect to their corresponding tick labels. Only has an effect for axes of <code>type</code> \"category\" or \"multicategory\". When set to \"boundaries\", ticks and grid lines are drawn half a category to the left/bottom of labels. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Note that the axis title position is always constrained within the margins, so the actual standoff distance is always less than the set or default value. By setting <code>standoff</code> and turning on <code>automargin</code>, plotly.js will push the margins to fit the axis title at given standoff distance. </li> <li>Sets the title of this axis. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to determined the axis type by looking into the data of the traces that referenced the axis in question. </li> <li>Controls persistence of user-driven changes in axis <code>range</code>, <code>autorange</code>, and <code>title</code> if in <code>editable: true</code> configuration. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. </li> <li>A single toggle to hide the axis while preserving interaction like dragging.

You can think of traces as collection of lines or bars on a chart. For example, <code>Total Revenue by Week</code> would be a trace. Once you define this metric in a single trace in your project, you can add it to as many charts as you want. This is especially powerful since charts are able to join disparate axis automatically. Meaning you can define a trace for <code>Revenue Per Week</code> and then define another trace for <code>Revenue per Day</code> and include both of those traces on the same chart with no extra configuration needed.</p> <p>This approach has a few key advantages:</p> <ul> <li>Modularity: Traces are repeatable across as many charts as you need.</li> <li>Single Source of Truth: Traces are singularly defined once in your project.</li> <li>Testable: Attributes of Traces are testable with simple configurations to make assertions about relationships that you expect to see in your data (ie. revenue = 300,000 on the week of 2022-09-19)</li> </ul> <p>Sometimes you might want to create a number of different series within a trace. For example you might want to know <code>Revenue Per Week by Account Executive</code>.

References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.line.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.line.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.line.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.line.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array.

Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding the marker points. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the bars. </li> <li>When there is no colorscale sets the color of background pattern fill. Defaults to a <code>marker.color</code> background when <code>fillmode</code> is \"overlay\". Otherwise, defaults to a transparent background. </li> <li>When there is no colorscale sets the color of foreground pattern fill. Defaults to a <code>marker.color</code> background when <code>fillmode</code> is \"replace\". Otherwise, defaults to dark grey or white to increase contrast with the <code>bgcolor</code>. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the foreground pattern fill. Defaults to a 0.5 when <code>fillmode</code> is \"overlay\". Otherwise, defaults to 1. </li> <li>Determines whether <code>marker.color</code> should be used as a default to <code>bgcolor</code> or a <code>fgcolor</code>. </li> <li>Sets the shape of the pattern fill. By default, no pattern is used for filling the area. </li> <li>Sets the size of unit squares of the pattern fill in pixels, which corresponds to the interval of repetition of the pattern. </li> <li>Sets the solidity of the pattern fill. Solidity is roughly the fraction of the area filled by the pattern. Solidity of 0 shows only the background color without pattern and solidty of 1 shows only the foreground color without pattern. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position axis units). In \"group\" barmode, traces that set \"offset\" will be excluded and drawn in \"overlay\" mode instead. </li> <li>Set several traces linked to the same position axis or matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the same position coordinate will line up. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the bars. With \"v\" (\"h\"), the value of the each bar spans along the vertical (horizontal). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the bar. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. With \"auto\" the texts may automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size in bars. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

If \"none\", no text appears. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information text that appear on points. Note that this will override <code>textinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>value</code> and <code>label</code>. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"By default the values are formatted using <code>xaxis.hoverformat</code>. </li> <li>Only relevant when the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\". Sets the base for period positioning in milliseconds or date string on the x0 axis.

In \"stack\" barmode, traces that set \"base\" will be excluded and drawn in \"overlay\" mode instead. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the r coordinate step. </li> <li>Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the <code>dtheta</code> step equals the subplot's period divided by the length of the <code>r</code> coordinates. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace.

The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.line.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.line.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.line.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.line.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding the marker points. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the bars. </li> <li>When there is no colorscale sets the color of background pattern fill. Defaults to a <code>marker.color</code> background when <code>fillmode</code> is \"overlay\". Otherwise, defaults to a transparent background. </li> <li>When there is no colorscale sets the color of foreground pattern fill. Defaults to a <code>marker.color</code> background when <code>fillmode</code> is \"replace\". Otherwise, defaults to dark grey or white to increase contrast with the <code>bgcolor</code>. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the foreground pattern fill. Defaults to a 0.5 when <code>fillmode</code> is \"overlay\". Otherwise, defaults to 1. </li> <li>Determines whether <code>marker.color</code> should be used as a default to <code>bgcolor</code> or a <code>fgcolor</code>. </li> <li>Sets the shape of the pattern fill. By default, no pattern is used for filling the area. </li> <li>Sets the size of unit squares of the pattern fill in pixels, which corresponds to the interval of repetition of the pattern. </li> <li>Sets the solidity of the pattern fill. Solidity is roughly the fraction of the area filled by the pattern. Solidity of 0 shows only the background color without pattern and solidty of 1 shows only the foreground color without pattern. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Shifts the angular position where the bar is drawn (in \"thetatunit\" units). </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Alternate to <code>r</code>. Builds a linear space of r coordinates. Use with <code>dr</code> where <code>r0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dr</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the radial coordinates </li> <li>Sets the marker color of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of selected points. </li> <li>Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's data coordinates and a polar subplot. If \"polar\" (the default value), the data refer to <code>layout.polar</code>. If \"polar2\", the data refer to <code>layout.polar2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets hover text elements associated with each bar. If a single string, the same string appears over all bars. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's coordinates. </li> <li>Alternate to <code>theta</code>. Builds a linear space of theta coordinates. Use with <code>dtheta</code> where <code>theta0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dtheta</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the angular coordinates </li> <li>Sets the unit of input \"theta\" values. Has an effect only when on \"linear\" angular axes. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the bar angular width (in \"thetaunit\" units).

When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the amount of jitter in the sample points drawn. If \"0\", the sample points align along the distribution axis. If \"1\", the sample points are drawn in a random jitter of width equal to the width of the box(es). </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the color of line bounding the box(es). </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of line bounding the box(es). </li> <li>Sets the lower fence values. There should be as many items as the number of boxes desired. This attribute has effect only under the q1/median/q3 signature. If <code>lowerfence</code> is not provided but a sample (in <code>y</code> or <code>x</code>) is set, we compute the lower as the last sample point below 1.5 times the IQR. </li> <li>Sets the marker angle in respect to <code>angleref</code>. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets the border line color of the outlier sample points. Defaults to marker.color </li> <li>Sets the border line width (in px) of the outlier sample points. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding the marker points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity. </li> <li>Sets the color of the outlier sample points. </li> <li>Sets the marker size (in px). </li> <li>Sets the marker symbol type. Adding 100 is equivalent to appending \"-open\" to a symbol name. Adding 200 is equivalent to appending \"-dot\" to a symbol name. Adding 300 is equivalent to appending \"-open-dot\" or \"dot-open\" to a symbol name. </li> <li>Sets the mean values. There should be as many items as the number of boxes desired. This attribute has effect only under the q1/median/q3 signature. If <code>mean</code> is not provided but a sample (in <code>y</code> or <code>x</code>) is set, we compute the mean for each box using the sample values. </li> <li>Sets the median values. There should be as many items as the number of boxes desired. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Determines whether or not notches are drawn. Notches displays a confidence interval around the median. We compute the confidence interval as median +/- 1.57 \" IQR / sqrt(N), where IQR is the interquartile range and N is the sample size. If two boxes' notches do not overlap there is 95% confidence their medians differ. See https://sites.google.com/site/davidsstatistics/home/notched-box-plots for more info. Defaults to \"false\" unless <code>notchwidth</code> or <code>notchspan</code> is set. </li> <li>Sets the notch span from the boxes' <code>median</code> values. There should be as many items as the number of boxes desired. This attribute has effect only under the q1/median/q3 signature. If <code>notchspan</code> is not provided but a sample (in <code>y</code> or <code>x</code>) is set, we compute it as 1.57 \" IQR / sqrt(N), where N is the sample size. </li> <li>Sets the width of the notches relative to the box' width. For example, with 0, the notches are as wide as the box(es). </li> <li>Set several traces linked to the same position axis or matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the same position coordinate will line up. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the box(es). If \"v\" (\"h\"), the distribution is visualized along the vertical (horizontal). </li> <li>Sets the position of the sample points in relation to the box(es). If \"0\", the sample points are places over the center of the box(es). Positive (negative) values correspond to positions to the right (left) for vertical boxes and above (below) for horizontal boxes </li> <li>Sets the Quartile 1 values. There should be as many items as the number of boxes desired. </li> <li>Sets the Quartile 3 values. There should be as many items as the number of boxes desired. </li> <li>Sets the method used to compute the sample's Q1 and Q3 quartiles. The \"linear\" method uses the 25th percentile for Q1 and 75th percentile for Q3 as computed using method #10 (listed on http://jse.amstat.org/v14n3/langford.html). The \"exclusive\" method uses the median to divide the ordered dataset into two halves if the sample is odd, it does not include the median in either half - Q1 is then the median of the lower half and Q3 the median of the upper half. The \"inclusive\" method also uses the median to divide the ordered dataset into two halves but if the sample is odd, it includes the median in both halves - Q1 is then the median of the lower half and Q3 the median of the upper half. </li> <li>Sets the standard deviation values. There should be as many items as the number of boxes desired. This attribute has effect only under the q1/median/q3 signature. If <code>sd</code> is not provided but a sample (in <code>y</code> or <code>x</code>) is set, we compute the standard deviation for each box using the sample values. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of selected points. </li> <li>Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Sets the text elements associated with each sample value. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the upper fence values. There should be as many items as the number of boxes desired. This attribute has effect only under the q1/median/q3 signature. If <code>upperfence</code> is not provided but a sample (in <code>y</code> or <code>x</code>) is set, we compute the lower as the last sample point above 1.5 times the IQR. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the width of the whiskers relative to the box' width. For example, with 1, the whiskers are as wide as the box(es). </li> <li>Sets the width of the box in data coordinate If \"0\" (default value) the width is automatically selected based on the positions of other box traces in the same subplot. </li> <li>Sets the x coordinate for single-box traces or the starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using q1/median/q3. See overview for more info. </li> <li>Sets the x sample data or coordinates. See overview for more info. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis</code>. If \"x2\", the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use with <code>x</code> date data. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>x</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"By default the values are formatted using <code>xaxis.hoverformat</code>. </li> <li>Only relevant when the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\". Sets the base for period positioning in milliseconds or date string on the x0 axis. When <code>x0period</code> is round number of weeks, the <code>x0period0</code> by default would be on a Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at 2000-01-01. </li> <li>Only relevant when the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\". Sets the period positioning in milliseconds or \"M\" on the x axis. Special values in the form of \"M\" could be used to declare the number of months. In this case <code>n</code> must be a positive integer.  <li>Only relevant when the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\". Sets the alignment of data points on the x axis. </li> <li>Sets the y coordinate for single-box traces or the starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using q1/median/q3. See overview for more info. </li> <li>Sets the y sample data or coordinates. See overview for more info. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If \"y\" (the default value), the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis</code>. If \"y2\", the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use with <code>y</code> date data. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>y</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python.

Used with <code>categoryorder</code>. </li> <li>Specifies the ordering logic for the case of categorical variables. By default, plotly uses \"trace\", which specifies the order that is present in the data supplied. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"category ascending\" or \"category descending\" if order should be determined by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"array\" to derive the ordering from the attribute <code>categoryarray</code>.

If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your desired range (e.g. to set the range from 1 to 100, set the range from 0 to 2). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be date strings, like date data, though Date objects and unix milliseconds will be accepted and converted to strings. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be numbers, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears. </li> <li>If \"normal\", the range is computed in relation to the extrema of the input data.

For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python.

These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>An additional amount by which to offset the title from the tick labels, given in pixels. Note that this used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleoffset</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of this axis. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the axis type. By default, plotly attempts to determined the axis type by looking into the data of the traces that referenced the axis in question. </li> <li>An identifier for this carpet, so that <code>scattercarpet</code> and <code>contourcarpet</code> traces can specify a carpet plot on which they lie </li> <li>The shift applied to each successive row of data in creating a cheater plot. Only used if <code>x</code> is been omitted. </li> <li>Sets default for all colors associated with this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid color is lightened by blending this with the plot background Individual pieces can override this. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the a coordinate step. See <code>a0</code> for more info. </li> <li>Sets the b coordinate step. See <code>b0</code> for more info. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>A two dimensional array of x coordinates at each carpet point. If omitted, the plot is a cheater plot and the xaxis is hidden by default. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis</code>. If \"x2\", the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>A two dimensional array of y coordinates at each carpet point. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If \"y\" (the default value), the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis</code>. If \"y2\", the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis2</code>, and so on. </li>

or the palette determined by <code>colorscale</code>. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the key in GeoJSON features which is used as id to match the items included in the <code>locations</code> array. Only has an effect when <code>geojson</code> is set. Support nested property, for example \"properties.name\". </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's geospatial coordinates and a geographic map. If \"geo\" (the default value), the geospatial coordinates refer to <code>layout.geo</code>. If \"geo2\", the geospatial coordinates refer to <code>layout.geo2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets optional GeoJSON data associated with this trace. If not given, the features on the base map are used. It can be set as a valid GeoJSON object or as a URL string. Note that we only accept GeoJSONs of type \"FeatureCollection\" or \"Feature\" with geometries of type \"Polygon\" or \"MultiPolygon\". </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Determines the set of locations used to match entries in <code>locations</code> to regions on the map. Values \"ISO-3\", \"USA-states\", \"country names\" correspond to features on the base map and value \"geojson-id\" corresponds to features from a custom GeoJSON linked to the <code>geojson</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the coordinates via location IDs or names. See <code>locationmode</code> for more info. </li> <li>Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding the marker points. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the locations. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, <code>zmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>zmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of selected points. </li> <li>Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the text elements associated with each location. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the color values. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>z</code>) or the bounds set in <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code> Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as in <code>z</code> and if set, <code>zmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>zmin</code> and/or <code>zmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as in <code>z</code>. Has no effect when <code>zauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as in <code>z</code> and if set, <code>zmax</code> must be set as well.

In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines if the choropleth polygons will be inserted before the layer with the specified ID. By default, choroplethmapbox traces are placed above the water layers. If set to '', the layer will be inserted above every existing layer. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the key in GeoJSON features which is used as id to match the items included in the <code>locations</code> array. Support nested property, for example \"properties.name\". </li> <li>Sets the GeoJSON data associated with this trace. It can be set as a valid GeoJSON object or as a URL string. Note that we only accept GeoJSONs of type \"FeatureCollection\" or \"Feature\" with geometries of type \"Polygon\" or \"MultiPolygon\". </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variable <code>properties</code> Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets which features found in \"geojson\" to plot using their feature <code>id</code> field. </li> <li>Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding the marker points. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the locations. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, <code>zmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>zmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of selected points. </li> <li>Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's data coordinates and a mapbox subplot. If \"mapbox\" (the default value), the data refer to <code>layout.mapbox</code>. If \"mapbox2\", the data refer to <code>layout.mapbox2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets the text elements associated with each location. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the color values. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>z</code>) or the bounds set in <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code> Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as in <code>z</code> and if set, <code>zmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>zmin</code> and/or <code>zmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as in <code>z</code>. Has no effect when <code>zauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as in <code>z</code> and if set, <code>zmax</code> must be set as well.

Note that \"cm\" denote the cone's center of mass which corresponds to 1/4 from the tail to tip. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>colorscale</code>. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here u/v/w norm) or the bounds set in <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code> Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as u/v/w norm and if set, <code>cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>cmin</code> and/or <code>cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as u/v/w norm. Has no effect when <code>cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as u/v/w norm and if set, <code>cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box.

The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variable <code>norm</code> Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Ambient light increases overall color visibility but can wash out the image. </li> <li>Represents the extent that incident rays are reflected in a range of angles. </li> <li>Epsilon for face normals calculation avoids math issues arising from degenerate geometry. </li> <li>Represents the reflectance as a dependency of the viewing angle; e.g. paper is reflective when viewing it from the edge of the paper (almost 90 degrees), causing shine. </li> <li>Alters specular reflection; the rougher the surface, the wider and less contrasty the shine. </li> <li>Represents the level that incident rays are reflected in a single direction, causing shine. </li> <li>Epsilon for vertex normals calculation avoids math issues arising from degenerate geometry. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the X coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the Y coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the Z coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in the case of using high <code>opacity</code> values for example a value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and 0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved in the near future and is subject to change. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, <code>cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's 3D coordinate system and a 3D scene. If \"scene\" (the default value), the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to <code>layout.scene</code>. If \"scene2\", the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to <code>layout.scene2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. </li> <li>Determines whether <code>sizeref</code> is set as a \"scaled\" (i.e unitless) scalar (normalized by the max u/v/w norm in the vector field) or as \"absolute\" value (in the same units as the vector field). </li> <li>Adjusts the cone size scaling. The size of the cones is determined by their u/v/w norm multiplied a factor and <code>sizeref</code>. This factor (computed internally) corresponds to the minimum \"time\" to travel across two successive x/y/z positions at the average velocity of those two successive positions. All cones in a given trace use the same factor. With <code>sizemode</code> set to \"scaled\", <code>sizeref</code> is unitless, its default value is \"0.5\" With <code>sizemode</code> set to \"absolute\", <code>sizeref</code> has the same units as the u/v/w vector field, its the default value is half the sample's maximum vector norm. </li> <li>Sets the text elements associated with the cones. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>Sets the x components of the vector field. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>u</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.By default the values are formatted using generic number format. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the y components of the vector field. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>v</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.By default the values are formatted using generic number format. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the z components of the vector field. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>w</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.By default the values are formatted using generic number format. </li> <li>Sets the x coordinates of the vector field and of the displayed cones. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>x</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python.

We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"By default the values are formatted using <code>xaxis.hoverformat</code>. </li> <li>Sets the y coordinates of the vector field and of the displayed cones. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>y</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python.

whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>colorscale</code>. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the contour level attributes are picked by an algorithm. If \"true\", the number of contour levels can be set in <code>ncontours</code>. If \"false\", set the contour level attributes in <code>contours</code>. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the <code>z</code> data are filled in. It is defaulted to true if <code>z</code> is a one dimensional array otherwise it is defaulted to false. </li> <li>Determines the coloring method showing the contour values. If \"fill\", coloring is done evenly between each contour level If \"heatmap\", a heatmap gradient coloring is applied between each contour level. If \"lines\", coloring is done on the contour lines. If \"none\", no coloring is applied on this trace. </li> <li>Sets the end contour level value. Must be more than <code>contours.start</code> </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the contour label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. </li> <li>Sets the constraint operation. \"=\" keeps regions equal to <code>value</code> \"&lt;\" and \"&lt;=\" keep regions less than <code>value</code> \"&gt;\" and \"&gt;=\" keep regions greater than <code>value</code> \"[]\", \"()\", \"[)\", and \"(]\" keep regions inside <code>value[0]</code> to <code>value[1]</code> \"]\", \")(\", \"[\" keep regions outside <code>value[0]</code> to value[1]` Open vs. closed intervals make no difference to constraint display, but all versions are allowed for consistency with filter transforms. </li> <li>Determines whether to label the contour lines with their values. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the contour lines are drawn. Has an effect only if <code>contours.coloring</code> is set to \"fill\". </li> <li>Sets the step between each contour level. Must be positive. </li> <li>Sets the starting contour level value. Must be less than <code>contours.end</code> </li> <li>If <code>levels</code>, the data is represented as a contour plot with multiple levels displayed. If <code>constraint</code>, the data is represented as constraints with the invalid region shaded as specified by the <code>operation</code> and <code>value</code> parameters. </li> <li>Sets the value or values of the constraint boundary. When <code>operation</code> is set to one of the comparison values (=,&lt;,&gt;=,&gt;,&lt;=) \"value\" is expected to be a number. When <code>operation</code> is set to one of the interval values ([],(),[),(],],)(,[) \"value\" is expected to be an array of two numbers where the first is the lower bound and the second is the upper bound. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the x coordinate step. See <code>x0</code> for more info. </li> <li>Sets the y coordinate step. See <code>y0</code> for more info. </li> <li>Sets the fill color if <code>contours.type</code> is \"constraint\". Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the <code>z</code> data have hover labels associated with them. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the color of the contour level. Has no effect if <code>contours.coloring</code> is set to \"lines\". </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Sets the amount of smoothing for the contour lines, where \"0\" corresponds to no smoothing. </li> <li>Sets the contour line width in (in px) Defaults to \"0.5\" when <code>contours.type</code> is \"levels\". Defaults to \"2\" when <code>contour.type</code> is \"constraint\". </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the maximum number of contour levels. The actual number of contours will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to the value of <code>ncontours</code>.

Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Alternate to <code>x</code>. Builds a linear space of x coordinates.

<ol> <li>Alternate to <code>x</code>. Builds a linear space of x coordinates. Use with <code>dx</code> where <code>x0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dx</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the x coordinates. </li> <li>If \"array\", the heatmap's x coordinates are given by \"x\" (the default behavior when <code>x</code> is provided). If \"scaled\", the heatmap's x coordinates are given by \"x0\" and \"dx\" (the default behavior when <code>x</code> is not provided). </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>colorscale</code>. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the contour level attributes are picked by an algorithm. If \"true\", the number of contour levels can be set in <code>ncontours</code>. If \"false\", set the contour level attributes in <code>contours</code>. </li> <li>Alternate to <code>y</code>. Builds a linear space of y coordinates. Use with <code>dy</code> where <code>y0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dy</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the y coordinates. </li> <li>If \"array\", the heatmap's y coordinates are given by \"y\" (the default behavior when <code>y</code> is provided) If \"scaled\", the heatmap's y coordinates are given by \"y0\" and \"dy\" (the default behavior when <code>y</code> is not provided) </li> <li>The <code>carpet</code> of the carpet axes on which this contour trace lies </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Determines the coloring method showing the contour values. If \"fill\", coloring is done evenly between each contour level If \"lines\", coloring is done on the contour lines. If \"none\", no coloring is applied on this trace. </li> <li>Sets the end contour level value. Must be more than <code>contours.start</code> </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. </li> <li>Sets the constraint operation. \"=\" keeps regions equal to <code>value</code> \"&lt;\" and \"&lt;=\" keep regions less than <code>value</code> \"&gt;\" and \"&gt;=\" keep regions greater than <code>value</code> \"[]\", \"()\", \"[)\", and \"(]\" keep regions inside <code>value[0]</code> to <code>value[1]</code> \"]\", \")(\", \"[\" keep regions outside <code>value[0]</code> to value[1]` Open vs. closed intervals make no difference to constraint display, but all versions are allowed for consistency with filter transforms. </li> <li>Determines whether to label the contour lines with their values. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the contour lines are drawn. Has an effect only if <code>contours.coloring</code> is set to \"fill\". </li> <li>Sets the step between each contour level. Must be positive. </li> <li>Sets the starting contour level value. Must be less than <code>contours.end</code> </li> <li>If <code>levels</code>, the data is represented as a contour plot with multiple levels displayed. If <code>constraint</code>, the data is represented as constraints with the invalid region shaded as specified by the <code>operation</code> and <code>value</code> parameters. </li> <li>Sets the value or values of the constraint boundary. When <code>operation</code> is set to one of the comparison values (=,&lt;,&gt;=,&gt;,&lt;=) \"value\" is expected to be a number. When <code>operation</code> is set to one of the interval values ([],(),[),(],],)(,[) \"value\" is expected to be an array of two numbers where the first is the lower bound and the second is the upper bound. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the x coordinate step. See <code>x0</code> for more info. </li> <li>Sets the y coordinate step. See <code>y0</code> for more info. </li> <li>Sets the fill color if <code>contours.type</code> is \"constraint\". Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the color of the contour level. Has no effect if <code>contours.coloring</code> is set to \"lines\". </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Sets the amount of smoothing for the contour lines, where \"0\" corresponds to no smoothing. </li> <li>Sets the contour line width in (in px) Defaults to \"0.5\" when <code>contours.type</code> is \"levels\". Defaults to \"2\" when <code>contour.type</code> is \"constraint\". </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the maximum number of contour levels. The actual number of contours will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to the value of <code>ncontours</code>. Has an effect only if <code>autocontour</code> is \"true\" or if <code>contours.size</code> is missing. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, <code>zmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>zmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the text elements associated with each z value. </li> <li>Transposes the z data. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis</code>. If \"x2\", the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If \"y\" (the default value), the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis</code>. If \"y2\", the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets the z data. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>z</code>) or the bounds set in <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code> Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as in <code>z</code> and if set, <code>zmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>zmin</code> and/or <code>zmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as in <code>z</code>. Has no effect when <code>zauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain.

palette determined by <code>colorscale</code>. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines if the densitymapbox trace will be inserted before the layer with the specified ID. By default, densitymapbox traces are placed below the first layer of type symbol If set to '', the layer will be inserted above every existing layer. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Sets hover text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (lon,lat) coordinates. To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the latitude coordinates (in degrees North). </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the longitude coordinates (in degrees East). </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Sets the radius of influence of one <code>lon</code> / <code>lat</code> point in pixels. Increasing the value makes the densitymapbox trace smoother, but less detailed. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, <code>zmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>zmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's data coordinates and a mapbox subplot. If \"mapbox\" (the default value), the data refer to <code>layout.mapbox</code>. If \"mapbox2\", the data refer to <code>layout.mapbox2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (lon,lat) coordinates. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the points' weight. For example, a value of 10 would be equivalent to having 10 points of weight 1 in the same spot </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>z</code>) or the bounds set in <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code> Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as in <code>z</code> and if set, <code>zmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>zmin</code> and/or <code>zmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as in <code>z</code>. Has no effect when <code>zauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as in <code>z</code> and if set, <code>zmax</code> must be set as well.

This controls whether bars compute their positional range dependently or independently. </li> <li>Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the subplot axes. To show the text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure to set <code>xaxis.layer</code> and <code>yaxis.layer</code> to \"below traces\". </li> <li>Sets the fill color. </li> <li>Sets the line color. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Sets the line width (in px). </li> <li>Determines if connector regions and lines are drawn. </li> <li>Constrain the size of text inside or outside a bar to be no larger than the bar itself. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the x coordinate step. See <code>x0</code> for more info. </li> <li>Sets the y coordinate step. See <code>y0</code> for more info. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering.

The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>percentInitial</code>, <code>percentPrevious</code> and <code>percentTotal</code>. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Determines if texts are kept at center or start/end points in <code>textposition</code> \"inside\" mode. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.line.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.line.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.line.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.line.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code>.

Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding the marker points. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the bars. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position axis units). In \"group\" barmode, traces that set \"offset\" will be excluded and drawn in \"overlay\" mode instead. </li> <li>Set several traces linked to the same position axis or matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the same position coordinate will line up. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the funnels. With \"v\" (\"h\"), the value of the each bar spans along the vertical (horizontal). By default funnels are tend to be oriented horizontally; unless only \"y\" array is presented or orientation is set to \"v\". Also regarding graphs including only 'horizontal' funnels, \"autorange\" on the \"y-axis\" are set to \"reversed\". </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the bar. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. With \"auto\" the texts may automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size in bars. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

In the case of having multiple funnels, percentages &amp; totals are computed separately (per trace). </li> <li>Specifies the location of the <code>text</code>. \"inside\" positions <code>text</code> inside, next to the bar end (rotated and scaled if needed). \"outside\" positions <code>text</code> outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text gets pushed inside. \"auto\" tries to position <code>text</code> inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar is stacked on this one the text is moved outside. If \"none\", no text appears. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information text that appear on points. Note that this will override <code>textinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>percentInitial</code>, <code>percentPrevious</code>, <code>percentTotal</code>, <code>label</code> and <code>value</code>. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the bar width (in position axis units). </li> <li>Alternate to <code>x</code>. Builds a linear space of x coordinates. Use with <code>dx</code> where <code>x0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dx</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the x coordinates. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis</code>. If \"x2\", the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>x</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"By default the values are formatted using <code>xaxis.hoverformat</code>. </li> <li>Only relevant when the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\". Sets the base for period positioning in milliseconds or date string on the x0 axis. When <code>x0period</code> is round number of weeks, the <code>x0period0</code> by default would be on a Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at 2000-01-01. </li> <li>Only relevant when the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\". Sets the period positioning in milliseconds or \"M\" on the x axis. Special values in the form of \"M\" could be used to declare the number of months. In this case <code>n</code> must be a positive integer.  <li>Only relevant when the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\". Sets the alignment of data points on the x axis. </li> <li>Alternate to <code>y</code>. Builds a linear space of y coordinates. Use with <code>dy</code> where <code>y0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dy</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the y coordinates. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If \"y\" (the default value), the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis</code>.

<code>colorscale</code>. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the <code>z</code> data are filled in. It is defaulted to true if <code>z</code> is a one dimensional array and <code>zsmooth</code> is not false; otherwise it is defaulted to false. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the x coordinate step. See <code>x0</code> for more info. </li> <li>Sets the y coordinate step. See <code>y0</code> for more info. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the <code>z</code> data have hover labels associated with them. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, <code>zmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>zmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the text elements associated with each z value. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information text that appear on points. Note that this will override <code>textinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\".

Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

(<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>colorscale</code>. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the x coordinate step. See <code>x0</code> for more info. </li> <li>Sets the y coordinate step. See <code>y0</code> for more info. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, <code>zmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>zmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the text elements associated with each z value. </li> <li>Transposes the z data. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Alternate to <code>x</code>. Builds a linear space of x coordinates. Use with <code>dx</code> where <code>x0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dx</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the x coordinates. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis</code>. If \"x2\", the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>If \"array\", the heatmap's x coordinates are given by \"x\" (the default behavior when <code>x</code> is provided). If \"scaled\", the heatmap's x coordinates are given by \"x0\" and \"dx\" (the default behavior when <code>x</code> is not provided). </li> <li>Alternate to <code>y</code>. Builds a linear space of y coordinates. Use with <code>dy</code> where <code>y0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dy</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the y coordinates. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If \"y\" (the default value), the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis</code>. If \"y2\", the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>If \"array\", the heatmap's y coordinates are given by \"y\" (the default behavior when <code>y</code> is provided) If \"scaled\", the heatmap's y coordinates are given by \"y0\" and \"dy\" (the default behavior when <code>y</code> is not provided) </li> <li>Sets the z data. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>z</code>) or the bounds set in <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code> Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as in <code>z</code> and if set, <code>zmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>zmin</code> and/or <code>zmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as in <code>z</code>. Has no effect when <code>zauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as in <code>z</code> and if set, <code>zmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Picks a smoothing algorithm use to smooth <code>z</code> data.

When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variable <code>binNumber</code> Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Determines if texts are kept at center or start/end points in <code>textposition</code> \"inside\" mode. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction).

Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>.

If \"none\", no text appears. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information text that appear on points. Note that this will override <code>textinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\".

Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

If \"x\" (the default value), the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis</code>. If \"x2\", the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets the end value for the x axis bins. The last bin may not end exactly at this value, we increment the bin edge by <code>size</code> from <code>start</code> until we reach or exceed <code>end</code>. Defaults to the maximum data value. Like <code>start</code>, for dates use a date string, and for category data <code>end</code> is based on the category serial numbers. </li> <li>Sets the size of each x axis bin. Default behavior: If <code>nbinsx</code> is 0 or omitted, we choose a nice round bin size such that the number of bins is about the same as the typical number of samples in each bin. If <code>nbinsx</code> is provided, we choose a nice round bin size giving no more than that many bins. For date data, use milliseconds or \"M\" for months, as in <code>axis.dtick</code>. For category data, the number of categories to bin together (always defaults to 1). If multiple non-overlaying histograms share a subplot, the first explicit <code>size</code> is used and all others discarded. If no <code>size</code> is provided,the sample data from all traces is combined to determine <code>size</code> as described above.  <li>Sets the starting value for the x axis bins. Defaults to the minimum data value, shifted down if necessary to make nice round values and to remove ambiguous bin edges. For example, if most of the data is integers we shift the bin edges 0.5 down, so a <code>size</code> of 5 would have a default <code>start</code> of -0.5, so it is clear that 0-4 are in the first bin, 5-9 in the second, but continuous data gets a start of 0 and bins [0,5), [5,10) etc. Dates behave similarly, and <code>start</code> should be a date string. For category data, <code>start</code> is based on the category serial numbers, and defaults to -0.5. If multiple non-overlaying histograms share a subplot, the first explicit <code>start</code> is used exactly and all others are shifted down (if necessary) to differ from that one by an integer number of bins. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use with <code>x</code> date data. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>x</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"By default the values are formatted using <code>xaxis.hoverformat</code>. </li> <li>Sets the sample data to be binned on the y axis. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If \"y\" (the default value), the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis</code>. If \"y2\", the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets the end value for the y axis bins.

is not needed. However, we accept <code>autobinx: true</code> or <code>false</code> and will update <code>xbins</code> accordingly before deleting <code>autobinx</code> from the trace. </li> <li>Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-determined separately and <code>autobiny</code> is not needed. However, we accept <code>autobiny: true</code> or <code>false</code> and will update <code>ybins</code> accordingly before deleting <code>autobiny</code> from the trace. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>colorscale</code>. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Set the <code>xbingroup</code> and <code>ybingroup</code> default prefix For example, setting a <code>bingroup</code> of \"1\" on two histogram2d traces will make them their x-bins and y-bins match separately. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Specifies the binning function used for this histogram trace. If \"count\", the histogram values are computed by counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If \"sum\", \"avg\", \"min\", \"max\", the histogram values are computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the maximum of the values lying inside each bin respectively. </li> <li>Specifies the type of normalization used for this histogram trace. If \"\", the span of each bar corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the number of data points lying inside the bins). If \"percent\" / \"probability\", the span of each bar corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences with respect to the total number of sample points (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If \"density\", the span of each bar corresponds to the number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals the total number of sample points). If \"probability density\", the area of each bar corresponds to the probability that an event will fall into the corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals 1). </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box.

The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variable <code>z</code> Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the aggregation data. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the optimal bin size such that the histogram best visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if <code>xbins.size</code> is provided. </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the optimal bin size such that the histogram best visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if <code>ybins.size</code> is provided. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, <code>zmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>zmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variable <code>z</code> </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the sample data to be binned on the x axis. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis</code>. If \"x2\", the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Set a group of histogram traces which will have compatible x-bin settings. Using <code>xbingroup</code>, histogram2d and histogram2dcontour traces (on axes of the same axis type) can have compatible x-bin settings. Note that the same <code>xbingroup</code> value can be used to set (1D) histogram <code>bingroup</code> </li> <li>Sets the end value for the x axis bins. The last bin may not end exactly at this value, we increment the bin edge by <code>size</code> from <code>start</code> until we reach or exceed <code>end</code>. Defaults to the maximum data value. Like <code>start</code>, for dates use a date string, and for category data <code>end</code> is based on the category serial numbers. </li> <li>Sets the size of each x axis bin. Default behavior: If <code>nbinsx</code> is 0 or omitted, we choose a nice round bin size such that the number of bins is about the same as the typical number of samples in each bin. If <code>nbinsx</code> is provided, we choose a nice round bin size giving no more than that many bins. For date data, use milliseconds or \"M\" for months, as in <code>axis.dtick</code>. For category data, the number of categories to bin together (always defaults to 1).   <li>Sets the starting value for the x axis bins. Defaults to the minimum data value, shifted down if necessary to make nice round values and to remove ambiguous bin edges. For example, if most of the data is integers we shift the bin edges 0.5 down, so a <code>size</code> of 5 would have a default <code>start</code> of -0.5, so it is clear that 0-4 are in the first bin, 5-9 in the second, but continuous data gets a start of 0 and bins [0,5), [5,10) etc. Dates behave similarly, and <code>start</code> should be a date string. For category data, <code>start</code> is based on the category serial numbers, and defaults to -0.5.  </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use with <code>x</code> date data. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal gap (in pixels) between bricks. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>x</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"By default the values are formatted using <code>xaxis.hoverformat</code>. </li> <li>Sets the sample data to be binned on the y axis. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If \"y\" (the default value), the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis</code>. If \"y2\", the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Set a group of histogram traces which will have compatible y-bin settings. Using <code>ybingroup</code>, histogram2d and histogram2dcontour traces (on axes of the same axis type) can have compatible y-bin settings. Note that the same <code>ybingroup</code> value can be used to set (1D) histogram <code>bingroup</code> </li> <li>Sets the end value for the y axis bins.

Like <code>start</code>, for dates use a date string, and for category data <code>end</code> is based on the category serial numbers. </li> <li>Sets the size of each y axis bin. Default behavior: If <code>nbinsy</code> is 0 or omitted, we choose a nice round bin size such that the number of bins is about the same as the typical number of samples in each bin.

However, we accept <code>autobinx: true</code> or <code>false</code> and will update <code>xbins</code> accordingly before deleting <code>autobinx</code> from the trace. </li> <li>Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-determined separately and <code>autobiny</code> is not needed. However, we accept <code>autobiny: true</code> or <code>false</code> and will update <code>ybins</code> accordingly before deleting <code>autobiny</code> from the trace. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>colorscale</code>. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the contour level attributes are picked by an algorithm. If \"true\", the number of contour levels can be set in <code>ncontours</code>. If \"false\", set the contour level attributes in <code>contours</code>. </li> <li>Set the <code>xbingroup</code> and <code>ybingroup</code> default prefix For example, setting a <code>bingroup</code> of \"1\" on two histogram2d traces will make them their x-bins and y-bins match separately. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>zmin</code> and <code>zmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Determines the coloring method showing the contour values. If \"fill\", coloring is done evenly between each contour level If \"heatmap\", a heatmap gradient coloring is applied between each contour level. If \"lines\", coloring is done on the contour lines. If \"none\", no coloring is applied on this trace. </li> <li>Sets the end contour level value. Must be more than <code>contours.start</code> </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Has an effect only if <code>contours.coloring</code> is set to \"fill\". </li> <li>Sets the step between each contour level. Must be positive. </li> <li>Sets the starting contour level value. Must be less than <code>contours.end</code> </li> <li>If <code>levels</code>, the data is represented as a contour plot with multiple levels displayed. If <code>constraint</code>, the data is represented as constraints with the invalid region shaded as specified by the <code>operation</code> and <code>value</code> parameters. </li> <li>Sets the value or values of the constraint boundary. When <code>operation</code> is set to one of the comparison values (=,&lt;,&gt;=,&gt;,&lt;=) \"value\" is expected to be a number. When <code>operation</code> is set to one of the interval values ([],(),[),(],],)(,[) \"value\" is expected to be an array of two numbers where the first is the lower bound and the second is the upper bound. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Specifies the binning function used for this histogram trace. If \"count\", the histogram values are computed by counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If \"sum\", \"avg\", \"min\", \"max\", the histogram values are computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the maximum of the values lying inside each bin respectively. </li> <li>Specifies the type of normalization used for this histogram trace. If \"\", the span of each bar corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the number of data points lying inside the bins). If \"percent\" / \"probability\", the span of each bar corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences with respect to the total number of sample points (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If \"density\", the span of each bar corresponds to the number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals the total number of sample points). If \"probability density\", the area of each bar corresponds to the probability that an event will fall into the corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals 1). </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering.

Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax.

Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of desired bins.

Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

The last bin may not end exactly at this value, we increment the bin edge by <code>size</code> from <code>start</code> until we reach or exceed <code>end</code>. Defaults to the maximum data value. Like <code>start</code>, for dates use a date string, and for category data <code>end</code> is based on the category serial numbers. </li> <li>Sets the size of each x axis bin. Default behavior: If <code>nbinsx</code> is 0 or omitted, we choose a nice round bin size such that the number of bins is about the same as the typical number of samples in each bin. If <code>nbinsx</code> is provided, we choose a nice round bin size giving no more than that many bins. For date data, use milliseconds or \"M\" for months, as in <code>axis.dtick</code>. For category data, the number of categories to bin together (always defaults to 1).   <li>Sets the starting value for the x axis bins. Defaults to the minimum data value, shifted down if necessary to make nice round values and to remove ambiguous bin edges. For example, if most of the data is integers we shift the bin edges 0.5 down, so a <code>size</code> of 5 would have a default <code>start</code> of -0.5, so it is clear that 0-4 are in the first bin, 5-9 in the second, but continuous data gets a start of 0 and bins [0,5), [5,10) etc. Dates behave similarly, and <code>start</code> should be a date string.

Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the level from which this trace hierarchy is rendered. Set <code>level</code> to <code>''</code> to start from the root node in the hierarchy. Must be an \"id\" if <code>ids</code> is filled in, otherwise plotly attempts to find a matching item in <code>labels</code>. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here colors) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array.

Value should have the same units as colors and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>.

These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the color for increasing value. </li> <li>Sets the symbol to display for increasing value </li> <li>Sets the position of delta with respect to the number. </li> <li>Sets a prefix appearing before the delta. </li> <li>Sets the reference value to compute the delta. By default, it is set to the current value. </li> <li>Show relative change </li> <li>Sets a suffix appearing next to the delta. </li> <li>Sets the value formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. </li> <li>If there is a layout grid, use the domain for this column in the grid for this indicator trace . </li> <li>If there is a layout grid, use the domain for this row in the grid for this indicator trace . </li> <li>Sets the horizontal domain of this indicator trace (in plot fraction). </li> <li>Sets the vertical domain of this indicator trace (in plot fraction). </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the range of this axis. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>A single toggle to hide the axis while preserving interaction like dragging. Default is true when a cheater plot is present on the axis, otherwise false </li> <li>Sets the background color of the arc. </li> <li>Sets the color of the line enclosing each sector. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the line enclosing each sector. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the bar as a fraction of the total thickness of the gauge. </li> <li>Sets the gauge background color. </li> <li>Sets the color of the border enclosing the gauge. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the border enclosing the gauge. </li> <li>Set the shape of the gauge </li> <li>Sets the background color of the arc. </li> <li>Sets the color of the line enclosing each sector. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the line enclosing each sector. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it).

If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the bar as a fraction of the total thickness of the gauge. </li> <li>Sets the color of the threshold line. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the threshold line. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the threshold line as a fraction of the thickness of the gauge. </li> <li>Sets a threshold value drawn as a line. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Determines how the value is displayed on the graph. <code>number</code> displays the value numerically in text. <code>delta</code> displays the difference to a reference value in text. Finally, <code>gauge</code> displays the value graphically on an axis. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the title. It defaults to <code>center</code> except for bullet charts for which it defaults to right. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates.

Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the number to be displayed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Sets the color of the contour lines. </li> <li>Sets whether or not dynamic contours are shown on hover </li> <li>Sets the width of the contour lines. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Determines whether or not normal smoothing is applied to the meshes, creating meshes with an angular, low-poly look via flat reflections. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the maximum boundary for iso-surface plot. </li> <li>Sets the minimum boundary for iso-surface plot. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Ambient light increases overall color visibility but can wash out the image. </li> <li>Represents the extent that incident rays are reflected in a range of angles. </li> <li>Epsilon for face normals calculation avoids math issues arising from degenerate geometry. </li> <li>Represents the reflectance as a dependency of the viewing angle; e.g. paper is reflective when viewing it from the edge of the paper (almost 90 degrees), causing shine. </li> <li>Alters specular reflection; the rougher the surface, the wider and less contrasty the shine. </li> <li>Represents the level that incident rays are reflected in a single direction, causing shine. </li> <li>Epsilon for vertex normals calculation avoids math issues arising from degenerate geometry. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the X coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the Y coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the Z coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in the case of using high <code>opacity</code> values for example a value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and 0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved in the near future and is subject to change. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, <code>cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's 3D coordinate system and a 3D scene. If \"scene\" (the default value), the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to <code>layout.scene</code>. If \"scene2\", the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to <code>layout.scene2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the <code>slices</code>. The default fill value of the <code>slices</code> is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Specifies the location(s) of slices on the axis. When not specified slices would be created for all points of the axis x except start and end. </li> <li>Determines whether or not slice planes about the x dimension are drawn. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the <code>slices</code>. The default fill value of the <code>slices</code> is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Specifies the location(s) of slices on the axis. When not specified slices would be created for all points of the axis y except start and end. </li> <li>Determines whether or not slice planes about the y dimension are drawn. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the <code>slices</code>. The default fill value of the <code>slices</code> is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Specifies the location(s) of slices on the axis. When not specified slices would be created for all points of the axis z except start and end. </li> <li>Determines whether or not slice planes about the z dimension are drawn. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the <code>spaceframe</code> elements. The default fill value is 0.15 meaning that only 15% of the area of every faces of tetras would be shaded. Applying a greater <code>fill</code> ratio would allow the creation of stronger elements or could be sued to have entirely closed areas (in case of using 1). </li> <li>Displays/hides tetrahedron shapes between minimum and maximum iso-values. Often useful when either caps or surfaces are disabled or filled with values less than 1. </li> <li>Sets the number of iso-surfaces between minimum and maximum iso-values. By default this value is 2 meaning that only minimum and maximum surfaces would be drawn. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the iso-surface. The default fill value of the surface is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Sets the surface pattern of the iso-surface 3-D sections. The default pattern of the surface is <code>all</code> meaning that the rest of surface elements would be shaded. The check options (either 1 or 2) could be used to draw half of the squares on the surface. Using various combinations of capital <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code> and <code>E</code> may also be used to reduce the number of triangles on the iso-surfaces and creating other patterns of interest. </li> <li>Hides/displays surfaces between minimum and maximum iso-values. </li> <li>Sets the text elements associated with the vertices. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the 4th dimension (value) of the vertices. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>value</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.By default the values are formatted using generic number format. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the X coordinates of the vertices on X axis. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>x</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"By default the values are formatted using <code>xaxis.hoverformat</code>. </li> <li>Sets the Y coordinates of the vertices on Y axis. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>y</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format.

the <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> arrays are not supplied. For general use of <code>mesh3d</code> it is preferred that <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> are supplied. If \"-1\", Delaunay triangulation is used, which is mainly suitable if the mesh is a single, more or less layer surface that is perpendicular to <code>delaunayaxis</code>. In case the <code>delaunayaxis</code> intersects the mesh surface at more than one point it will result triangles that are very long in the dimension of <code>delaunayaxis</code>. If \"&gt;0\", the alpha-shape algorithm is used. In this case, the positive <code>alphahull</code> value signals the use of the alpha-shape algorithm, and its value acts as the parameter for the mesh fitting. If \"0\", the convex-hull algorithm is used. It is suitable for convex bodies or if the intention is to enclose the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> point set into a convex hull. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>colorscale</code>. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here <code>intensity</code>) or the bounds set in <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code> Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as <code>intensity</code> and if set, <code>cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>cmin</code> and/or <code>cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as <code>intensity</code>. Has no effect when <code>cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as <code>intensity</code> and if set, <code>cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the color of the whole mesh </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Sets the color of the contour lines. </li> <li>Sets whether or not dynamic contours are shown on hover </li> <li>Sets the width of the contour lines. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the Delaunay axis, which is the axis that is perpendicular to the surface of the Delaunay triangulation. It has an effect if <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> are not provided and <code>alphahull</code> is set to indicate Delaunay triangulation. </li> <li>Sets the color of each face Overrides \"color\" and \"vertexcolor\". </li> <li>Determines whether or not normal smoothing is applied to the meshes, creating meshes with an angular, low-poly look via flat reflections. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between 0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing the \"first\" vertex of a triangle. For example, <code>{i[m], j[m], k[m]}</code> together represent face m (triangle m) in the mesh, where <code>i[m] = n</code> points to the triplet <code>{x[n], y[n], z[n]}</code> in the vertex arrays. Therefore, each element in <code>i</code> represents a point in space, which is the first vertex of a triangle. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the intensity values for vertices or cells as defined by <code>intensitymode</code>. It can be used for plotting fields on meshes. </li> <li>Determines the source of <code>intensity</code> values. </li> <li>A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between 0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing the \"second\" vertex of a triangle. For example, <code>{i[m], j[m], k[m]}</code> together represent face m (triangle m) in the mesh, where <code>j[m] = n</code> points to the triplet <code>{x[n], y[n], z[n]}</code> in the vertex arrays. Therefore, each element in <code>j</code> represents a point in space, which is the second vertex of a triangle. </li> <li>A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between 0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing the \"third\" vertex of a triangle. For example, <code>{i[m], j[m], k[m]}</code> together represent face m (triangle m) in the mesh, where <code>k[m] = n</code> points to the triplet <code>{x[n], y[n], z[n]}</code> in the vertex arrays. Therefore, each element in <code>k</code> represents a point in space, which is the third vertex of a triangle. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Ambient light increases overall color visibility but can wash out the image. </li> <li>Represents the extent that incident rays are reflected in a range of angles. </li> <li>Epsilon for face normals calculation avoids math issues arising from degenerate geometry. </li> <li>Represents the reflectance as a dependency of the viewing angle; e.g. paper is reflective when viewing it from the edge of the paper (almost 90 degrees), causing shine. </li> <li>Alters specular reflection; the rougher the surface, the wider and less contrasty the shine. </li> <li>Represents the level that incident rays are reflected in a single direction, causing shine. </li> <li>Epsilon for vertex normals calculation avoids math issues arising from degenerate geometry. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the X coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the Y coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the Z coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in the case of using high <code>opacity</code> values for example a value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and 0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved in the near future and is subject to change. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, <code>cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's 3D coordinate system and a 3D scene. If \"scene\" (the default value), the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to <code>layout.scene</code>. If \"scene2\", the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to <code>layout.scene2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the text elements associated with the vertices. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the color of each vertex Overrides \"color\". While Red, green and blue colors are in the range of 0 and 255; in the case of having vertex color data in RGBA format, the alpha color should be normalized to be between 0 and 1. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the X coordinates of the vertices. The nth element of vectors <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> jointly represent the X, Y and Z coordinates of the nth vertex. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use with <code>x</code> date data. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>x</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"By default the values are formatted using <code>xaxis.hoverformat</code>. </li> <li>Sets the Y coordinates of the vertices. The nth element of vectors <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> jointly represent the X, Y and Z coordinates of the nth vertex. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use with <code>y</code> date data. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>y</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python.

Set <code>categoryorder</code> to \"array\" to derive the ordering from the attribute <code>categoryarray</code>. If a category is not found in the <code>categoryarray</code> array, the sorting behavior for that attribute will be identical to the \"trace\" mode. The unspecified categories will follow the categories in <code>categoryarray</code>. </li> <li>The display index of dimension, from left to right, zero indexed, defaults to dimension index. </li> <li>The shown name of the dimension. </li> <li>Sets alternative tick labels for the categories in this dimension. Only has an effect if <code>categoryorder</code> is set to \"array\". Should be an array the same length as <code>categoryarray</code> Used with <code>categoryorder</code>. </li> <li>Dimension values. <code>values[n]</code> represents the category value of the <code>n</code>th point in the dataset, therefore the <code>values</code> vector for all dimensions must be the same (longer vectors will be truncated). </li> <li>Shows the dimension when set to <code>true</code> (the default). Hides the dimension for <code>false</code>. </li> <li>If there is a layout grid, use the domain for this column in the grid for this parcats trace . </li> <li>If there is a layout grid, use the domain for this row in the grid for this parcats trace . </li> <li>Sets the horizontal domain of this parcats trace (in plot fraction). </li> <li>Sets the vertical domain of this parcats trace (in plot fraction). </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the hover interaction mode for the parcats diagram. If <code>category</code>, hover interaction take place per category. If <code>color</code>, hover interactions take place per color per category. If <code>dimension</code>, hover interactions take place across all categories per dimension. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>count</code>, <code>probability</code>, <code>category</code>, <code>categorycount</code>, <code>colorcount</code> and <code>bandcolorcount</code>. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>line.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>line.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>line.cmin</code> and <code>line.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>line.cmin</code> and <code>line.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>line.color</code> and if set, <code>line.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>line.cmin</code> and/or <code>line.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>line.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>line.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>line.color</code> and if set, <code>line.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>line.cmin</code> and <code>line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>line.cmin</code> and <code>line.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>count</code> and <code>probability</code>. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>line.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>line.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets the shape of the paths. If <code>linear</code>, paths are composed of straight lines. If <code>hspline</code>, paths are composed of horizontal curved splines </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the path sorting algorithm. If <code>forward</code>, sort paths based on dimension categories from left to right. If <code>backward</code>, sort paths based on dimensions categories from right to left. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>The domain range to which the filter on the dimension is constrained. Must be an array of <code>[fromValue, toValue]</code> with <code>fromValue &lt;= toValue</code>, or if <code>multiselect</code> is not disabled, you may give an array of arrays, where each inner array is <code>[fromValue, toValue]</code>. </li> <li>The shown name of the dimension. </li> <li>Do we allow multiple selection ranges or just a single range? </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>The domain range that represents the full, shown axis extent. Defaults to the <code>values</code> extent. Must be an array of <code>[fromValue, toValue]</code> with finite numbers as elements. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. </li> <li>Dimension values. <code>values[n]</code> represents the value of the <code>n</code>th point in the dataset, therefore the <code>values</code> vector for all dimensions must be the same (longer vectors will be truncated). Each value must be a finite number. </li> <li>Shows the dimension when set to <code>true</code> (the default). Hides the dimension for <code>false</code>. </li> <li>If there is a layout grid, use the domain for this column in the grid for this parcoords trace . </li> <li>If there is a layout grid, use the domain for this row in the grid for this parcoords trace . </li> <li>Sets the horizontal domain of this parcoords trace (in plot fraction). </li> <li>Sets the vertical domain of this parcoords trace (in plot fraction). </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the angle of the labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the labels vertically. Tilted labels with \"labelangle\" may be positioned better inside margins when <code>labelposition</code> is set to \"bottom\". </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Specifies the location of the <code>label</code>. \"top\" positions labels above, next to the title \"bottom\" positions labels below the graph Tilted labels with \"labelangle\" may be positioned better inside margins when <code>labelposition</code> is set to \"bottom\". </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>line.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>line.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>line.cmin</code> and <code>line.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>line.cmin</code> and <code>line.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>line.color</code> and if set, <code>line.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>line.cmin</code> and/or <code>line.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>line.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>line.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>line.color</code> and if set, <code>line.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>line.cmin</code> and <code>line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it).

If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear.

Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>line.cmin</code> and <code>line.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>line.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>line.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the base color of unselected lines. in connection with <code>unselected.line.opacity</code>. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of unselected lines.

Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the values of the sectors.

Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax.

Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the <code>node</code> color. It can be a single value, or an array for specifying color for each <code>node</code>. If <code>node.color</code> is omitted, then the default <code>Plotly</code> color palette will be cycled through to have a variety of colors. These defaults are not fully opaque, to allow some visibility of what is beneath the node. </li> <li>Assigns extra data to each node. </li> <li>Groups of nodes. Each group is defined by an array with the indices of the nodes it contains. Multiple groups can be specified. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear when hovering nodes. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the value formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. </li> <li>Adds a unit to follow the value in the hover tooltip. Add a space if a separation is necessary from the value. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li>

Defaults to \"none\" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets \"tonexty\" (\"tonextx\") if <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" (\"h\") Use with <code>fillcolor</code> if not \"none\". \"tozerox\" and \"tozeroy\" fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. \"tonextx\" and \"tonexty\" fill between the endpoints of this trace and the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave like \"tozerox\" and \"tozeroy\". \"toself\" connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. \"tonext\" fills the space between two traces if one completely encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like \"toself\" if there is no trace before it. \"tonext\" should not be used if one trace does not enclose the other. Traces in a <code>stackgroup</code> will only fill to (or be filled to) other traces in the same group. With multiple <code>stackgroup</code>s or some traces stacked and some not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order. </li> <li>Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available. </li> <li>When there is no colorscale sets the color of background pattern fill. Defaults to a <code>marker.color</code> background when <code>fillmode</code> is \"overlay\". Otherwise, defaults to a transparent background. </li> <li>When there is no colorscale sets the color of foreground pattern fill. Defaults to a <code>marker.color</code> background when <code>fillmode</code> is \"replace\". Otherwise, defaults to dark grey or white to increase contrast with the <code>bgcolor</code>. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the foreground pattern fill. Defaults to a 0.5 when <code>fillmode</code> is \"overlay\". Otherwise, defaults to 1. </li> <li>Determines whether <code>marker.color</code> should be used as a default to <code>bgcolor</code> or a <code>fgcolor</code>. </li> <li>Sets the shape of the pattern fill. By default, no pattern is used for filling the area. </li> <li>Sets the size of unit squares of the pattern fill in pixels, which corresponds to the interval of repetition of the pattern. </li> <li>Sets the solidity of the pattern fill. Solidity is roughly the fraction of the area filled by the pattern. Solidity of 0 shows only the background color without pattern and solidty of 1 shows only the foreground color without pattern. </li> <li>Only relevant when <code>stackgroup</code> is used, and only the first <code>groupnorm</code> found in the <code>stackgroup</code> will be used - including if <code>visible</code> is \"legendonly\" but not if it is <code>false</code>. Sets the normalization for the sum of this <code>stackgroup</code>. With \"fraction\", the value of each trace at each location is divided by the sum of all trace values at that location. \"percent\" is the same but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are multiple subplots, or multiple <code>stackgroup</code>s on one subplot, each will be normalized within its own set. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Do the hover effects highlight individual points (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled regions? If the fill is \"toself\" or \"tonext\" and there are no markers or text, then the default is \"fills\", otherwise it is \"points\". </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the line back off from the end point of the nth line segment (in px). This option is useful e.g. to avoid overlap with arrowhead markers. With \"auto\" the lines would trim before markers if <code>marker.angleref</code> is set to \"previous\". </li> <li>Sets the line color. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Determines the line shape. With \"spline\" the lines are drawn using spline interpolation. The other available values correspond to step-wise line shapes. </li> <li>Simplifies lines by removing nearly-collinear points. When transitioning lines, it may be desirable to disable this so that the number of points along the resulting SVG path is unaffected. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>shape</code> is set to \"spline\" Sets the amount of smoothing. \"0\" corresponds to no smoothing (equivalent to a \"linear\" shape). </li> <li>Sets the line width (in px). </li> <li>Sets the marker angle in respect to <code>angleref</code>. </li> <li>Sets the reference for marker angle. With \"previous\", angle 0 points along the line from the previous point to this one. With \"up\", angle 0 points toward the top of the screen. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Sets the final color of the gradient fill: the center color for radial, the right for horizontal, or the bottom for vertical. </li> <li>Sets the type of gradient used to fill the markers </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.line.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.line.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.line.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.line.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding the marker points. </li> <li>Sets a maximum number of points to be drawn on the graph. \"0\" corresponds to no limit. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Sets the marker size (in px). </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the minimum size (in px) of the rendered marker points. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the rule for which the data in <code>size</code> is converted to pixels. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the scale factor used to determine the rendered size of marker points. Use with <code>sizemin</code> and <code>sizemode</code>. </li> <li>Moves the marker away from the data point in the direction of <code>angle</code> (in px). This can be useful for example if you have another marker at this location and you want to point an arrowhead marker at it. </li> <li>Sets the marker symbol type. Adding 100 is equivalent to appending \"-open\" to a symbol name. Adding 200 is equivalent to appending \"-dot\" to a symbol name. Adding 300 is equivalent to appending \"-open-dot\" or \"dot-open\" to a symbol name. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If the provided <code>mode</code> includes \"text\" then the <code>text</code> elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the <code>text</code> elements appear on hover. If there are less than 20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default is \"lines+markers\". Otherwise, \"lines\". </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Only relevant when <code>stackgroup</code> is used, and only the first <code>orientation</code> found in the <code>stackgroup</code> will be used - including if <code>visible</code> is \"legendonly\" but not if it is <code>false</code>. Sets the stacking direction. With \"v\" (\"h\"), the y (x) values of subsequent traces are added. Also affects the default value of <code>fill</code>. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of selected points. </li> <li>Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Only relevant when <code>stackgroup</code> is used, and only the first <code>stackgaps</code> found in the <code>stackgroup</code> will be used - including if <code>visible</code> is \"legendonly\" but not if it is <code>false</code>. Determines how we handle locations at which other traces in this group have data but this one does not. With \"infer zero\" we insert a zero at these locations. With \"interpolate\" we linearly interpolate between existing values, and extrapolate a constant beyond the existing values. </li> <li>Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or their x values if <code>orientation</code> is \"h\"). If blank or omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also turns <code>fill</code> on by default, using \"tonexty\" (\"tonextx\") if <code>orientation</code> is \"h\" (\"v\") and sets the default <code>mode</code> to \"lines\" irrespective of point count. You can only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in a <code>stackgroup</code> will only fill to (or be filled to) other traces in the same group. With multiple <code>stackgroup</code>s or some traces stacked and some not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order. </li> <li>Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the positions of the <code>text</code> elements with respects to the (x,y) coordinates. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information text that appear on points. Note that this will override <code>textinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available.  </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Alternate to <code>x</code>. Builds a linear space of x coordinates. Use with <code>dx</code> where <code>x0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dx</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the x coordinates. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis</code>. If \"x2\", the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use with <code>x</code> date data. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>x</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"By default the values are formatted using <code>xaxis.hoverformat</code>. </li> <li>Only relevant when the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\". Sets the base for period positioning in milliseconds or date string on the x0 axis. When <code>x0period</code> is round number of weeks, the <code>x0period0</code> by default would be on a Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at 2000-01-01. </li> <li>Only relevant when the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\". Sets the period positioning in milliseconds or \"M\" on the x axis. Special values in the form of \"M\" could be used to declare the number of months. In this case <code>n</code> must be a positive integer.  <li>Only relevant when the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\". Sets the alignment of data points on the x axis. </li> <li>Alternate to <code>y</code>. Builds a linear space of y coordinates. Use with <code>dy</code> where <code>y0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dy</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the y coordinates. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If \"y\" (the default value), the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis</code>. If \"y2\", the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use with <code>y</code> date data. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>y</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python.

Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax.

The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>line.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>line.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>line.cmin</code> and <code>line.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>line.cmin</code> and <code>line.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>line.color</code> and if set, <code>line.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>line.cmin</code> and/or <code>line.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>line.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>line.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>line.color</code> and if set, <code>line.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>line.cmin</code> and <code>line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>line.cmin</code> and <code>line.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of the lines. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>line.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>line.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if in <code>line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Sets the line width (in px). </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info).

Otherwise, \"lines\". </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Sets the projection color. </li> <li>Sets the scale factor determining the size of the projection marker points. </li> <li>Sets whether or not projections are shown along the x axis. </li> <li>Sets the projection color. </li> <li>Sets the scale factor determining the size of the projection marker points. </li> <li>Sets whether or not projections are shown along the y axis. </li> <li>Sets the projection color. </li> <li>Sets the scale factor determining the size of the projection marker points. </li> <li>Sets whether or not projections are shown along the z axis. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's 3D coordinate system and a 3D scene. If \"scene\" (the default value), the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to <code>layout.scene</code>. If \"scene2\", the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to <code>layout.scene2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>If \"-1\", the scatter points are not fill with a surface If \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", the scatter points are filled with a Delaunay surface about the x, y, z respectively. </li> <li>Sets the surface fill color. </li> <li>Sets text elements associated with each (x,y,z) triplet. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y,z) coordinates. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the positions of the <code>text</code> elements with respects to the (x,y) coordinates. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information text that appear on points. Note that this will override <code>textinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available.  </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the x coordinates. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use with <code>x</code> date data. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>x</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"By default the values are formatted using <code>xaxis.hoverformat</code>. </li> <li>Sets the y coordinates. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use with <code>y</code> date data. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>y</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format.

that <code>scattercarpet</code> and <code>contourcarpet</code> traces can specify a carpet plot on which they lie </li> <li>Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the provided data arrays are connected. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with <code>fillcolor</code> if not \"none\". scatterternary has a subset of the options available to scatter. \"toself\" connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. \"tonext\" fills the space between two traces if one completely encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like \"toself\" if there is no trace before it. \"tonext\" should not be used if one trace does not enclose the other. </li> <li>Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Do the hover effects highlight individual points (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled regions? If the fill is \"toself\" or \"tonext\" and there are no markers or text, then the default is \"fills\", otherwise it is \"points\". </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Sets hover text elements associated with each (a,b) point. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of strings, the items are mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b). To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the line back off from the end point of the nth line segment (in px). This option is useful e.g. to avoid overlap with arrowhead markers. With \"auto\" the lines would trim before markers if <code>marker.angleref</code> is set to \"previous\". </li> <li>Sets the line color. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Determines the line shape. With \"spline\" the lines are drawn using spline interpolation. The other available values correspond to step-wise line shapes. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>shape</code> is set to \"spline\" Sets the amount of smoothing. \"0\" corresponds to no smoothing (equivalent to a \"linear\" shape). </li> <li>Sets the line width (in px). </li> <li>Sets the marker angle in respect to <code>angleref</code>. </li> <li>Sets the reference for marker angle. With \"previous\", angle 0 points along the line from the previous point to this one. With \"up\", angle 0 points toward the top of the screen. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Sets the final color of the gradient fill: the center color for radial, the right for horizontal, or the bottom for vertical. </li> <li>Sets the type of gradient used to fill the markers </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.line.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.line.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain.

Has no effect when <code>marker.line.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis.

Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding the marker points. </li> <li>Sets a maximum number of points to be drawn on the graph. \"0\" corresponds to no limit. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Sets the marker size (in px). </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the minimum size (in px) of the rendered marker points. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the rule for which the data in <code>size</code> is converted to pixels. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the scale factor used to determine the rendered size of marker points. Use with <code>sizemin</code> and <code>sizemode</code>. </li> <li>Moves the marker away from the data point in the direction of <code>angle</code> (in px). This can be useful for example if you have another marker at this location and you want to point an arrowhead marker at it. </li> <li>Sets the marker symbol type. Adding 100 is equivalent to appending \"-open\" to a symbol name. Adding 200 is equivalent to appending \"-dot\" to a symbol name. Adding 300 is equivalent to appending \"-open-dot\" or \"dot-open\" to a symbol name. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If the provided <code>mode</code> includes \"text\" then the <code>text</code> elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the <code>text</code> elements appear on hover. If there are less than 20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default is \"lines+markers\". Otherwise, \"lines\". </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of selected points. </li> <li>Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Sets text elements associated with each (a,b) point. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of strings, the items are mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b). If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the positions of the <code>text</code> elements with respects to the (x,y) coordinates. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information text that appear on points. Note that this will override <code>textinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis</code>. If \"x2\", the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If \"y\" (the default value), the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis</code>. If \"y2\", the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis2</code>, and so on. </li>"},{"location":"reference/configuration/Trace/Scattergeo/","title":"Scattergeo","text":"<pre><code>connectgaps:

Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Sets hover text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair or item in <code>locations</code>. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (lon,lat) or <code>locations</code> coordinates. To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the latitude coordinates (in degrees North). </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the line color. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Sets the line width (in px). </li> <li>Determines the set of locations used to match entries in <code>locations</code> to regions on the map. Values \"ISO-3\", \"USA-states\", \"country names\" correspond to features on the base map and value \"geojson-id\" corresponds to features from a custom GeoJSON linked to the <code>geojson</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the coordinates via location IDs or names. Coordinates correspond to the centroid of each location given. See <code>locationmode</code> for more info. </li> <li>Sets the longitude coordinates (in degrees East). </li> <li>Sets the marker angle in respect to <code>angleref</code>. </li> <li>Sets the reference for marker angle. With \"previous\", angle 0 points along the line from the previous point to this one. With \"up\", angle 0 points toward the top of the screen. With \"north\", angle 0 points north based on the current map projection. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Sets the final color of the gradient fill: the center color for radial, the right for horizontal, or the bottom for vertical. </li> <li>Sets the type of gradient used to fill the markers </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.line.colorscale</code>.

This can be useful for example if you have another marker at this location and you want to point an arrowhead marker at it. </li> <li>Sets the marker symbol type. Adding 100 is equivalent to appending \"-open\" to a symbol name. Adding 200 is equivalent to appending \"-dot\" to a symbol name. Adding 300 is equivalent to appending \"-open-dot\" or \"dot-open\" to a symbol name. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question.

Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

If \"data\", the bar lengths are set with data set</code>array`. </li> <li>Sets the value of either the percentage (if <code>type</code> is set to \"percent\") or the constant (if <code>type</code> is set to \"constant\") corresponding to the lengths of the error bars. </li> <li>Sets the value of either the percentage (if <code>type</code> is set to \"percent\") or the constant (if <code>type</code> is set to \"constant\") corresponding to the lengths of the error bars in the bottom (left) direction for vertical (horizontal) bars </li> <li>Determines whether or not this set of error bars is visible. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the cross-bar at both ends of the error bars. </li> <li>Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to \"none\" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets \"tonexty\" (\"tonextx\") if <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" (\"h\") Use with <code>fillcolor</code> if not \"none\". \"tozerox\" and \"tozeroy\" fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. \"tonextx\" and \"tonexty\" fill between the endpoints of this trace and the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave like \"tozerox\" and \"tozeroy\". \"toself\" connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. \"tonext\" fills the space between two traces if one completely encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like \"toself\" if there is no trace before it. \"tonext\" should not be used if one trace does not enclose the other. Traces in a <code>stackgroup</code> will only fill to (or be filled to) other traces in the same group. With multiple <code>stackgroup</code>s or some traces stacked and some not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order. </li> <li>Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the line color. </li> <li>Sets the style of the lines. </li> <li>Determines the line shape. The values correspond to step-wise line shapes. </li> <li>Sets the line width (in px). </li> <li>Sets the marker angle in respect to <code>angleref</code>. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.line.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.line.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array.

Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale.

Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding the marker points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true.

Sets the minimum size (in px) of the rendered marker points. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the rule for which the data in <code>size</code> is converted to pixels. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the scale factor used to determine the rendered size of marker points. Use with <code>sizemin</code> and <code>sizemode</code>. </li> <li>Sets the marker symbol type. Adding 100 is equivalent to appending \"-open\" to a symbol name. Adding 200 is equivalent to appending \"-dot\" to a symbol name. Adding 300 is equivalent to appending \"-open-dot\" or \"dot-open\" to a symbol name. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question.

Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available.  </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Alternate to <code>x</code>. Builds a linear space of x coordinates. Use with <code>dx</code> where <code>x0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dx</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the x coordinates. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis</code>. If \"x2\", the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use with <code>x</code> date data. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>x</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"By default the values are formatted using <code>xaxis.hoverformat</code>. </li> <li>Only relevant when the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\". Sets the base for period positioning in milliseconds or date string on the x0 axis. When <code>x0period</code> is round number of weeks, the <code>x0period0</code> by default would be on a Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at 2000-01-01. </li> <li>Only relevant when the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\". Sets the period positioning in milliseconds or \"M\" on the x axis. Special values in the form of \"M\" could be used to declare the number of months. In this case <code>n</code> must be a positive integer.  <li>Only relevant when the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\". Sets the alignment of data points on the x axis. </li> <li>Alternate to <code>y</code>. Builds a linear space of y coordinates. Use with <code>dy</code> where <code>y0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dy</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the y coordinates. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If \"y\" (the default value), the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis</code>. If \"y2\", the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use with <code>y</code> date data. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>y</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python.

specified ID. By default, scattermapbox layers are inserted above all the base layers. To place the scattermapbox layers above every other layer, set <code>below</code> to \"''\". </li> <li>Sets the color for each cluster step. </li> <li>Determines whether clustering is enabled or disabled. </li> <li>Sets the maximum zoom level. At zoom levels equal to or greater than this, points will never be clustered. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity. </li> <li>Sets the size for each cluster step. </li> <li>Sets how many points it takes to create a cluster or advance to the next cluster step. Use this in conjunction with arrays for <code>size</code> and / or <code>color</code>. If an integer, steps start at multiples of this number. If an array, each step extends from the given value until one less than the next value. </li> <li>Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the provided data arrays are connected. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with <code>fillcolor</code> if not \"none\". \"toself\" connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. </li> <li>Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Sets hover text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (lon,lat) coordinates. To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the latitude coordinates (in degrees North). </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the line color. </li> <li>Sets the line width (in px). </li> <li>Sets the longitude coordinates (in degrees East). </li> <li>Flag to draw all symbols, even if they overlap. </li> <li>Sets the marker orientation from true North, in degrees clockwise. When using the \"auto\" default, no rotation would be applied in perspective views which is different from using a zero angle. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Sets the marker size (in px). </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the minimum size (in px) of the rendered marker points. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the rule for which the data in <code>size</code> is converted to pixels. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the scale factor used to determine the rendered size of marker points. Use with <code>sizemin</code> and <code>sizemode</code>. </li> <li>Sets the marker symbol. Full list: https://www.mapbox.com/maki-icons/ Note that the array <code>marker.color</code> and <code>marker.size</code> are only available for \"circle\" symbols. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If the provided <code>mode</code> includes \"text\" then the <code>text</code> elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the <code>text</code> elements appear on hover. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of selected points. </li> <li>Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's data coordinates and a mapbox subplot. If \"mapbox\" (the default value), the data refer to <code>layout.mapbox</code>. If \"mapbox2\", the data refer to <code>layout.mapbox2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (lon,lat) coordinates. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the positions of the <code>text</code> elements with respects to the (x,y) coordinates. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information text that appear on points. Note that this will override <code>textinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>lat</code>, <code>lon</code> and <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

To show markers and text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure to set <code>xaxis.layer</code> and <code>yaxis.layer</code> to \"below traces\". </li> <li>Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the provided data arrays are connected. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the r coordinate step. </li> <li>Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the <code>dtheta</code> step equals the subplot's period divided by the length of the <code>r</code> coordinates. </li> <li>Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with <code>fillcolor</code> if not \"none\". scatterpolar has a subset of the options available to scatter. \"toself\" connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. \"tonext\" fills the space between two traces if one completely encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like \"toself\" if there is no trace before it. \"tonext\" should not be used if one trace does not enclose the other. </li> <li>Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Do the hover effects highlight individual points (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled regions? If the fill is \"toself\" or \"tonext\" and there are no markers or text, then the default is \"fills\", otherwise it is \"points\". </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the line back off from the end point of the nth line segment (in px). This option is useful e.g. to avoid overlap with arrowhead markers. With \"auto\" the lines would trim before markers if <code>marker.angleref</code> is set to \"previous\". </li> <li>Sets the line color. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Determines the line shape. With \"spline\" the lines are drawn using spline interpolation. The other available values correspond to step-wise line shapes. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>shape</code> is set to \"spline\" Sets the amount of smoothing. \"0\" corresponds to no smoothing (equivalent to a \"linear\" shape). </li> <li>Sets the line width (in px). </li> <li>Sets the marker angle in respect to <code>angleref</code>. </li> <li>Sets the reference for marker angle. With \"previous\", angle 0 points along the line from the previous point to this one. With \"up\", angle 0 points toward the top of the screen. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Sets the final color of the gradient fill: the center color for radial, the right for horizontal, or the bottom for vertical. </li> <li>Sets the type of gradient used to fill the markers </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.line.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.line.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.line.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.line.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding the marker points. </li> <li>Sets a maximum number of points to be drawn on the graph. \"0\" corresponds to no limit. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Sets the marker size (in px). </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the minimum size (in px) of the rendered marker points. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the rule for which the data in <code>size</code> is converted to pixels. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the scale factor used to determine the rendered size of marker points. Use with <code>sizemin</code> and <code>sizemode</code>. </li> <li>Moves the marker away from the data point in the direction of <code>angle</code> (in px). This can be useful for example if you have another marker at this location and you want to point an arrowhead marker at it. </li> <li>Sets the marker symbol type. Adding 100 is equivalent to appending \"-open\" to a symbol name. Adding 200 is equivalent to appending \"-dot\" to a symbol name. Adding 300 is equivalent to appending \"-open-dot\" or \"dot-open\" to a symbol name. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If the provided <code>mode</code> includes \"text\" then the <code>text</code> elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the <code>text</code> elements appear on hover. If there are less than 20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default is \"lines+markers\". Otherwise, \"lines\". </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Alternate to <code>r</code>. Builds a linear space of r coordinates. Use with <code>dr</code> where <code>r0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dr</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the radial coordinates </li> <li>Sets the marker color of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of selected points. </li> <li>Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's data coordinates and a polar subplot. If \"polar\" (the default value), the data refer to <code>layout.polar</code>. If \"polar2\", the data refer to <code>layout.polar2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the positions of the <code>text</code> elements with respects to the (x,y) coordinates. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information text that appear on points. Note that this will override <code>textinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>r</code>, <code>theta</code> and <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Alternate to <code>theta</code>. Builds a linear space of theta coordinates. Use with <code>dtheta</code> where <code>theta0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dtheta</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the angular coordinates </li> <li>Sets the unit of input \"theta\" values. Has an effect only when on \"linear\" angular axes. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

<li>Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the provided data arrays are connected. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the r coordinate step. </li> <li>Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the <code>dtheta</code> step equals the subplot's period divided by the length of the <code>r</code> coordinates. </li> <li>Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to \"none\" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets \"tonexty\" (\"tonextx\") if <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" (\"h\") Use with <code>fillcolor</code> if not \"none\". \"tozerox\" and \"tozeroy\" fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. \"tonextx\" and \"tonexty\" fill between the endpoints of this trace and the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave like \"tozerox\" and \"tozeroy\". \"toself\" connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. \"tonext\" fills the space between two traces if one completely encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like \"toself\" if there is no trace before it. \"tonext\" should not be used if one trace does not enclose the other. Traces in a <code>stackgroup</code> will only fill to (or be filled to) other traces in the same group. With multiple <code>stackgroup</code>s or some traces stacked and some not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order. </li> <li>Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box.

Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the line color. </li> <li>Sets the style of the lines. </li> <li>Determines the line shape. The values correspond to step-wise line shapes. </li> <li>Sets the line width (in px). </li> <li>Sets the marker angle in respect to <code>angleref</code>. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.line.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.line.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.line.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.line.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding the marker points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Sets the marker size (in px). </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the minimum size (in px) of the rendered marker points. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the rule for which the data in <code>size</code> is converted to pixels. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the scale factor used to determine the rendered size of marker points. Use with <code>sizemin</code> and <code>sizemode</code>. </li> <li>Sets the marker symbol type. Adding 100 is equivalent to appending \"-open\" to a symbol name. Adding 200 is equivalent to appending \"-dot\" to a symbol name. Adding 300 is equivalent to appending \"-open-dot\" or \"dot-open\" to a symbol name. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If the provided <code>mode</code> includes \"text\" then the <code>text</code> elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the <code>text</code> elements appear on hover. If there are less than 20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default is \"lines+markers\". Otherwise, \"lines\". </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Alternate to <code>r</code>. Builds a linear space of r coordinates. Use with <code>dr</code> where <code>r0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dr</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the radial coordinates </li> <li>Sets the marker color of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of selected points. </li> <li>Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's data coordinates and a polar subplot. If \"polar\" (the default value), the data refer to <code>layout.polar</code>. If \"polar2\", the data refer to <code>layout.polar2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the positions of the <code>text</code> elements with respects to the (x,y) coordinates. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information text that appear on points. Note that this will override <code>textinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>r</code>, <code>theta</code> and <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Alternate to <code>theta</code>. Builds a linear space of theta coordinates. Use with <code>dtheta</code> where <code>theta0</code> is the starting coordinate and <code>dtheta</code> the step. </li> <li>Sets the angular coordinates </li> <li>Sets the unit of input \"theta\" values. Has an effect only when on \"linear\" angular axes. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

To show markers and text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure to set <code>xaxis.layer</code> and <code>yaxis.layer</code> to \"below traces\". </li> <li>Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the provided data arrays are connected. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with <code>fillcolor</code> if not \"none\". scattersmith has a subset of the options available to scatter. \"toself\" connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. \"tonext\" fills the space between two traces if one completely encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like \"toself\" if there is no trace before it. \"tonext\" should not be used if one trace does not enclose the other. </li> <li>Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Do the hover effects highlight individual points (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled regions? If the fill is \"toself\" or \"tonext\" and there are no markers or text, then the default is \"fills\", otherwise it is \"points\". </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the imaginary component of the data, in units of normalized impedance such that real=1, imag=0 is the center of the chart. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the line back off from the end point of the nth line segment (in px). This option is useful e.g. to avoid overlap with arrowhead markers. With \"auto\" the lines would trim before markers if <code>marker.angleref</code> is set to \"previous\". </li> <li>Sets the line color. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Determines the line shape. With \"spline\" the lines are drawn using spline interpolation. The other available values correspond to step-wise line shapes. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>shape</code> is set to \"spline\" Sets the amount of smoothing. \"0\" corresponds to no smoothing (equivalent to a \"linear\" shape). </li> <li>Sets the line width (in px). </li> <li>Sets the marker angle in respect to <code>angleref</code>. </li> <li>Sets the reference for marker angle. With \"previous\", angle 0 points along the line from the previous point to this one. With \"up\", angle 0 points toward the top of the screen. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Sets the final color of the gradient fill: the center color for radial, the right for horizontal, or the bottom for vertical. </li> <li>Sets the type of gradient used to fill the markers </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.line.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.line.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain.

Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Sets the marker size (in px). </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the minimum size (in px) of the rendered marker points. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the rule for which the data in <code>size</code> is converted to pixels. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the scale factor used to determine the rendered size of marker points. Use with <code>sizemin</code> and <code>sizemode</code>. </li> <li>Moves the marker away from the data point in the direction of <code>angle</code> (in px). This can be useful for example if you have another marker at this location and you want to point an arrowhead marker at it. </li> <li>Sets the marker symbol type. Adding 100 is equivalent to appending \"-open\" to a symbol name. Adding 200 is equivalent to appending \"-dot\" to a symbol name. Adding 300 is equivalent to appending \"-open-dot\" or \"dot-open\" to a symbol name. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If the provided <code>mode</code> includes \"text\" then the <code>text</code> elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the <code>text</code> elements appear on hover. If there are less than 20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default is \"lines+markers\". Otherwise, \"lines\". </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Sets the real component of the data, in units of normalized impedance such that real=1, imag=0 is the center of the chart. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of selected points. </li> <li>Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's data coordinates and a smith subplot. If \"smith\" (the default value), the data refer to <code>layout.smith</code>. If \"smith2\", the data refer to <code>layout.smith2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the positions of the <code>text</code> elements with respects to the (x,y) coordinates. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information text that appear on points. Note that this will override <code>textinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>real</code>, <code>imag</code> and <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

If <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> are all provided, they need not be normalized, only the relative values matter. If only two arrays are provided they must be normalized to match <code>ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum</code>. </li> <li>Sets the quantity of component <code>a</code> in each data point. If <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> are all provided, they need not be normalized, only the relative values matter. If only two arrays are provided they must be normalized to match <code>ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum</code>. </li> <li>Sets the quantity of component <code>a</code> in each data point. If <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> are all provided, they need not be normalized, only the relative values matter. If only two arrays are provided they must be normalized to match <code>ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum</code>. </li> <li>Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure to set <code>xaxis.layer</code> and <code>yaxis.layer</code> to \"below traces\". </li> <li>Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the provided data arrays are connected. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with <code>fillcolor</code> if not \"none\". scatterternary has a subset of the options available to scatter. \"toself\" connects the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. \"tonext\" fills the space between two traces if one completely encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like \"toself\" if there is no trace before it. \"tonext\" should not be used if one trace does not enclose the other. </li> <li>Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is available. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Do the hover effects highlight individual points (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled regions? If the fill is \"toself\" or \"tonext\" and there are no markers or text, then the default is \"fills\", otherwise it is \"points\". </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Sets hover text elements associated with each (a,b,c) point. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of strings, the items are mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b,c). To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the line back off from the end point of the nth line segment (in px). This option is useful e.g. to avoid overlap with arrowhead markers. With \"auto\" the lines would trim before markers if <code>marker.angleref</code> is set to \"previous\". </li> <li>Sets the line color. </li> <li>Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (\"solid\", \"dot\", \"dash\", \"longdash\", \"dashdot\", or \"longdashdot\") or a dash length list in px (eg \"5px,10px,2px,2px\"). </li> <li>Determines the line shape. With \"spline\" the lines are drawn using spline interpolation. The other available values correspond to step-wise line shapes. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>shape</code> is set to \"spline\" Sets the amount of smoothing. \"0\" corresponds to no smoothing (equivalent to a \"linear\" shape). </li> <li>Sets the line width (in px). </li> <li>Sets the marker angle in respect to <code>angleref</code>. </li> <li>Sets the reference for marker angle. With \"previous\", angle 0 points along the line from the previous point to this one. With \"up\", angle 0 points toward the top of the screen. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Sets the final color of the gradient fill: the center color for radial, the right for horizontal, or the bottom for vertical. </li> <li>Sets the type of gradient used to fill the markers </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.line.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.line.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain.

Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding the marker points. </li> <li>Sets a maximum number of points to be drawn on the graph. \"0\" corresponds to no limit. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Sets the marker size (in px). </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the minimum size (in px) of the rendered marker points. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the rule for which the data in <code>size</code> is converted to pixels. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the scale factor used to determine the rendered size of marker points. Use with <code>sizemin</code> and <code>sizemode</code>. </li> <li>Moves the marker away from the data point in the direction of <code>angle</code> (in px). This can be useful for example if you have another marker at this location and you want to point an arrowhead marker at it. </li> <li>Sets the marker symbol type. Adding 100 is equivalent to appending \"-open\" to a symbol name. Adding 200 is equivalent to appending \"-dot\" to a symbol name. Adding 300 is equivalent to appending \"-open-dot\" or \"dot-open\" to a symbol name. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If the provided <code>mode</code> includes \"text\" then the <code>text</code> elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the <code>text</code> elements appear on hover. If there are less than 20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default is \"lines+markers\". Otherwise, \"lines\". </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of selected points. </li> <li>Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's data coordinates and a ternary subplot. If \"ternary\" (the default value), the data refer to <code>layout.ternary</code>. If \"ternary2\", the data refer to <code>layout.ternary2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>The number each triplet should sum to, if only two of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> are provided. This overrides <code>ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum</code> to normalize this specific trace, but does not affect the values displayed on the axes. 0 (or missing) means to use ternary.sum  <li>Sets text elements associated with each (a,b,c) point. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of strings, the items are mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b,c). If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the positions of the <code>text</code> elements with respects to the (x,y) coordinates. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information text that appear on points. Note that this will override <code>textinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code> and <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the text font color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the marker angle in respect to <code>angleref</code>. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.line.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here in <code>marker.line.color</code>) or the bounds set in <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array.

Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.line.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code>. Has no effect when <code>marker.line.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as in <code>marker.line.color</code> and if set, <code>marker.line.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale.

Has an effect only if in <code>marker.line.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.line.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding the marker points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if in <code>marker.color</code> is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Sets the marker size (in px). </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the minimum size (in px) of the rendered marker points. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the rule for which the data in <code>size</code> is converted to pixels. </li> <li>Has an effect only if <code>marker.size</code> is set to a numerical array. Sets the scale factor used to determine the rendered size of marker points. Use with <code>sizemin</code> and <code>sizemode</code>. </li> <li>Sets the marker symbol type. Adding 100 is equivalent to appending \"-open\" to a symbol name. Adding 200 is equivalent to appending \"-dot\" to a symbol name. Adding 300 is equivalent to appending \"-open-dot\" or \"dot-open\" to a symbol name. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of selected points. </li> <li>Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Determines whether or not subplots on the lower half from the diagonal are displayed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not subplots on the upper half from the diagonal are displayed. </li> <li>Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair to appear on hover. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the list of x axes corresponding to dimensions of this splom trace. By default, a splom will match the first N xaxes where N is the number of input dimensions. Note that, in case where <code>diagonal.visible</code> is false and <code>showupperhalf</code> or <code>showlowerhalf</code> is false, this splom trace will generate one less x-axis and one less y-axis. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>x</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"By default the values are formatted using <code>xaxis.hoverformat</code>. </li> <li>Sets the list of y axes corresponding to dimensions of this splom trace. By default, a splom will match the first N yaxes where N is the number of input dimensions. Note that, in case where <code>diagonal.visible</code> is false and <code>showupperhalf</code> or <code>showlowerhalf</code> is false, this splom trace will generate one less x-axis and one less y-axis. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>y</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python.

In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here u/v/w norm) or the bounds set in <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code> Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as u/v/w norm and if set, <code>cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>cmin</code> and/or <code>cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as u/v/w norm. Has no effect when <code>cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as u/v/w norm and if set, <code>cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>tubex</code>, <code>tubey</code>, <code>tubez</code>, <code>tubeu</code>, <code>tubev</code>, <code>tubew</code>, <code>norm</code> and <code>divergence</code>. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Ambient light increases overall color visibility but can wash out the image. </li> <li>Represents the extent that incident rays are reflected in a range of angles. </li> <li>Epsilon for face normals calculation avoids math issues arising from degenerate geometry. </li> <li>Represents the reflectance as a dependency of the viewing angle; e.g. paper is reflective when viewing it from the edge of the paper (almost 90 degrees), causing shine. </li> <li>Alters specular reflection; the rougher the surface, the wider and less contrasty the shine. </li> <li>Represents the level that incident rays are reflected in a single direction, causing shine. </li> <li>Epsilon for vertex normals calculation avoids math issues arising from degenerate geometry. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the X coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the Y coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the Z coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>The maximum number of displayed segments in a streamtube. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in the case of using high <code>opacity</code> values for example a value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and 0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved in the near future and is subject to change. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, <code>cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's 3D coordinate system and a 3D scene. If \"scene\" (the default value), the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to <code>layout.scene</code>. If \"scene2\", the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to <code>layout.scene2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. </li> <li>The scaling factor for the streamtubes. The default is 1, which avoids two max divergence tubes from touching at adjacent starting positions. </li> <li>Sets the x components of the starting position of the streamtubes </li> <li>Sets the y components of the starting position of the streamtubes </li> <li>Sets the z components of the starting position of the streamtubes </li> <li>Sets a text element associated with this trace.

For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.By default the values are formatted using generic number format. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the y components of the vector field. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>v</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python.

Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>currentPath</code>, <code>root</code>, <code>entry</code>, <code>percentRoot</code>, <code>percentEntry</code> and <code>percentParent</code>. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Sets hover text elements associated with each sector. If a single string, the same string appears for all data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order of this trace's sectors. To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates.

When set to \"auto\", text may be oriented in any direction in order to be as big as possible in the middle of a sector. The \"horizontal\" option orients text to be parallel with the bottom of the chart, and may make text smaller in order to achieve that goal. The \"radial\" option orients text along the radius of the sector. The \"tangential\" option orients text perpendicular to the radius of the sector. </li> <li>Sets the labels of each of the sectors. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the leaves.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the level from which this trace hierarchy is rendered. Set <code>level</code> to <code>''</code> to start from the root node in the hierarchy. Must be an \"id\" if <code>ids</code> is filled in, otherwise plotly attempts to find a matching item in <code>labels</code>. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here colors) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as colors and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as colors. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as colors and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the color of each sector of this trace. If not specified, the default trace color set is used to pick the sector colors. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Sets the color of the line enclosing each sector. Defaults to the <code>paper_bgcolor</code> value. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the line enclosing each sector. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Sets the number of rendered sectors from any given <code>level</code>. Set <code>maxdepth</code> to \"-1\" to render all the levels in the hierarchy. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the parent sectors for each of the sectors. Empty string items '' are understood to reference the root node in the hierarchy. If <code>ids</code> is filled, <code>parents</code> items are understood to be \"ids\" themselves. When <code>ids</code> is not set, plotly attempts to find matching items in <code>labels</code>, but beware they must be unique. </li> <li>sets the color of the root node for a sunburst/treemap/icicle trace. this has no effect when a colorscale is used to set the markers. </li> <li>Rotates the whole diagram counterclockwise by some angle. By default the first slice starts at 3 o'clock. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the sectors are reordered from largest to smallest. </li> <li>Sets text elements associated with each sector. If trace <code>textinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag, these elements will be seen on the chart. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on the graph. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information text that appear on points. Note that this will override <code>textinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>currentPath</code>, <code>root</code>, <code>entry</code>, <code>percentRoot</code>, <code>percentEntry</code>, <code>percentParent</code>, <code>label</code> and <code>value</code>. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the values associated with each of the sectors. Use with <code>branchvalues</code> to determine how the values are summed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here z or surfacecolor) or the bounds set in <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code> Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as z or surfacecolor and if set, <code>cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>cmin</code> and/or <code>cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as z or surfacecolor. Has no effect when <code>cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as z or surfacecolor and if set, <code>cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing values) in the <code>z</code> data are filled in. </li> <li>Sets the color of the contour lines. </li> <li>Sets the end contour level value.

The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Ambient light increases overall color visibility but can wash out the image. </li> <li>Represents the extent that incident rays are reflected in a range of angles. </li> <li>Represents the reflectance as a dependency of the viewing angle; e.g. paper is reflective when viewing it from the edge of the paper (almost 90 degrees), causing shine. </li> <li>Alters specular reflection; the rougher the surface, the wider and less contrasty the shine. </li> <li>Represents the level that incident rays are reflected in a single direction, causing shine. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the X coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the Y coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the Z coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in the case of using high <code>opacity</code> values for example a value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and 0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved in the near future and is subject to change. </li> <li>Sets the opacityscale. The opacityscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an opacity value. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 1], [0.5, 0.2], [1, 1]]</code> means that higher/lower values would have higher opacity values and those in the middle would be more transparent Alternatively, <code>opacityscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: 'min', 'max', 'extremes' and 'uniform'. The default is 'uniform'. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, <code>cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's 3D coordinate system and a 3D scene. If \"scene\" (the default value), the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to <code>layout.scene</code>. If \"scene2\", the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to <code>layout.scene2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the surface color values, used for setting a color scale independent of <code>z</code>. </li> <li>Sets the text elements associated with each z value. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the x coordinates. </li> <li>Sets the calendar system to use with <code>x</code> date data. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>x</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python.

This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>If there is a layout grid, use the domain for this column in the grid for this treemap trace . </li> <li>If there is a layout grid, use the domain for this row in the grid for this treemap trace . </li> <li>Sets the horizontal domain of this treemap trace (in plot fraction). </li> <li>Sets the vertical domain of this treemap trace (in plot fraction). </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering.

The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>currentPath</code>, <code>root</code>, <code>entry</code>, <code>percentRoot</code>, <code>percentEntry</code> and <code>percentParent</code>. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Sets hover text elements associated with each sector. If a single string, the same string appears for all data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order of this trace's sectors. To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the level from which this trace hierarchy is rendered. Set <code>level</code> to <code>''</code> to start from the root node in the hierarchy. Must be an \"id\" if <code>ids</code> is filled in, otherwise plotly attempts to find a matching item in <code>labels</code>. </li> <li>Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette (<code>autocolorscale: true</code>) or the palette determined by <code>marker.colorscale</code>. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here colors) or the bounds set in <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as colors and if set, <code>marker.cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>marker.cmin</code> and/or <code>marker.cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as colors. Has no effect when <code>marker.cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. Value should have the same units as colors and if set, <code>marker.cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the color of each sector of this trace. If not specified, the default trace color set is used to pick the sector colors. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Determines if the sector colors are faded towards the background from the leaves up to the headers. This option is unavailable when a <code>colorscale</code> is present, defaults to false when <code>marker.colors</code> is set, but otherwise defaults to true. When set to \"reversed\", the fading direction is inverted, that is the top elements within hierarchy are drawn with fully saturated colors while the leaves are faded towards the background color. </li> <li>Sets the color of the line enclosing each sector. Defaults to the <code>paper_bgcolor</code> value. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the line enclosing each sector. </li> <li>Sets the padding form the bottom (in px). </li> <li>Sets the padding form the left (in px). </li> <li>Sets the padding form the right (in px). </li> <li>Sets the padding form the top (in px). </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. If true, <code>marker.cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>marker.cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. Has an effect only if colors is set to a numerical array. </li> <li>Sets the number of rendered sectors from any given <code>level</code>. Set <code>maxdepth</code> to \"-1\" to render all the levels in the hierarchy. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the parent sectors for each of the sectors. Empty string items '' are understood to reference the root node in the hierarchy. If <code>ids</code> is filled, <code>parents</code> items are understood to be \"ids\" themselves. When <code>ids</code> is not set, plotly attempts to find matching items in <code>labels</code>, but beware they must be unique. </li> <li>Determines which shape is used for edges between <code>barpath</code> labels. </li> <li>Determines on which side of the the treemap the <code>pathbar</code> should be presented. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

If trace <code>textinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag, these elements will be seen on the chart. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser.

Note that this will override <code>textinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. variables <code>currentPath</code>, <code>root</code>, <code>entry</code>, <code>percentRoot</code>, <code>percentEntry</code>, <code>percentParent</code>, <code>label</code> and <code>value</code>. </li> <li>Determines if the positions obtained from solver are flipped on each axis. </li> <li>Determines d3 treemap solver. For more info please refer to https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy#treemap-tiling </li> <li>Sets the inner padding (in px). </li> <li>When using \"squarify\" <code>packing</code> algorithm, according to https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/v3.1.1/README.md#squarify_ratio this option specifies the desired aspect ratio of the generated rectangles. The ratio must be specified as a number greater than or equal to one. Note that the orientation of the generated rectangles (tall or wide) is not implied by the ratio; for example, a ratio of two will attempt to produce a mixture of rectangles whose width:height ratio is either 2:1 or 1:2. When using \"squarify\", unlike d3 which uses the Golden Ratio i.e. 1.618034, Plotly applies 1 to increase squares in treemap layouts. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the values associated with each of the sectors. Use with <code>branchvalues</code> to determine how the values are summed. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible).

Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the amount of jitter in the sample points drawn. If \"0\", the sample points align along the distribution axis. If \"1\", the sample points are drawn in a random jitter of width equal to the width of the violins. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the color of line bounding the violin(s). </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of line bounding the violin(s). </li> <li>Sets the marker angle in respect to <code>angleref</code>. </li> <li>Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.cmin</code> and <code>marker.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets the marker.line color. It accepts either a specific color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the colorscale relative to the max and min values of the array or relative to <code>marker.line.cmin</code> and <code>marker.line.cmax</code> if set. </li> <li>Sets the border line color of the outlier sample points. Defaults to marker.color </li> <li>Sets the border line width (in px) of the outlier sample points. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding the marker points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity. </li> <li>Sets the color of the outlier sample points. </li> <li>Sets the marker size (in px). </li> <li>Sets the marker symbol type. Adding 100 is equivalent to appending \"-open\" to a symbol name. Adding 200 is equivalent to appending \"-dot\" to a symbol name. Adding 300 is equivalent to appending \"-open-dot\" or \"dot-open\" to a symbol name. </li> <li>Sets the mean line color. </li> <li>Determines if a line corresponding to the sample's mean is shown inside the violins. If <code>box.visible</code> is turned on, the mean line is drawn inside the inner box. Otherwise, the mean line is drawn from one side of the violin to other. </li> <li>Sets the mean line width. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Set several traces linked to the same position axis or matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the same position coordinate will line up. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the trace. </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the violin(s). If \"v\" (\"h\"), the distribution is visualized along the vertical (horizontal). </li> <li>Sets the position of the sample points in relation to the violins. If \"0\", the sample points are places over the center of the violins. Positive (negative) values correspond to positions to the right (left) for vertical violins and above (below) for horizontal violins. </li> <li>If \"outliers\", only the sample points lying outside the whiskers are shown If \"suspectedoutliers\", the outlier points are shown and points either less than 4\"Q1-3\"Q3 or greater than 4\"Q3-3\"Q1 are highlighted (see <code>outliercolor</code>) If \"all\", all sample points are shown If \"false\", only the violins are shown with no sample points. Defaults to \"suspectedoutliers\" when <code>marker.outliercolor</code> or <code>marker.line.outliercolor</code> is set, otherwise defaults to \"outliers\". </li> <li>Sets the method used to compute the sample's Q1 and Q3 quartiles. The \"linear\" method uses the 25th percentile for Q1 and 75th percentile for Q3 as computed using method #10 (listed on http://jse.amstat.org/v14n3/langford.html). The \"exclusive\" method uses the median to divide the ordered dataset into two halves if the sample is odd, it does not include the median in either half - Q1 is then the median of the lower half and Q3 the median of the upper half. The \"inclusive\" method also uses the median to divide the ordered dataset into two halves but if the sample is odd, it includes the median in both halves - Q1 is then the median of the lower half and Q3 the median of the upper half. </li> <li>If there are multiple violins that should be sized according to to some metric (see <code>scalemode</code>), link them by providing a non-empty group id here shared by every trace in the same group. If a violin's <code>width</code> is undefined, <code>scalegroup</code> will default to the trace's name. In this case, violins with the same names will be linked together </li> <li>Sets the metric by which the width of each violin is determined. \"width\" means each violin has the same (max) width \"count\" means the violins are scaled by the number of sample points making up each violin. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of selected points. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of selected points. </li> <li>Array containing integer indices of selected points. Has an effect only for traces that support selections. Note that an empty array means an empty selection where the <code>unselected</code> are turned on for all points, whereas, any other non-array values means no selection all where the <code>selected</code> and <code>unselected</code> styles have no effect. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Determines on which side of the position value the density function making up one half of a violin is plotted. Useful when comparing two violin traces under \"overlay\" mode, where one trace has <code>side</code> set to \"positive\" and the other to \"negative\". </li> <li>Sets the span in data space for which the density function will be computed. Has an effect only when <code>spanmode</code> is set to \"manual\". </li> <li>Sets the method by which the span in data space where the density function will be computed. \"soft\" means the span goes from the sample's minimum value minus two bandwidths to the sample's maximum value plus two bandwidths. \"hard\" means the span goes from the sample's minimum to its maximum value. For custom span settings, use mode \"manual\" and fill in the <code>span</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the text elements associated with each sample value. If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. To be seen, trace <code>hoverinfo</code> must contain a \"text\" flag. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the marker color of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker opacity of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Sets the marker size of unselected points, applied only when a selection exists. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the width of the violin in data coordinates. If \"0\" (default value) the width is automatically selected based on the positions of other violin traces in the same subplot. </li> <li>Sets the x coordinate for single-box traces or the starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using q1/median/q3. See overview for more info. </li> <li>Sets the x sample data or coordinates. See overview for more info. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis</code>. If \"x2\", the x coordinates refer to <code>layout.xaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>x</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"By default the values are formatted using <code>xaxis.hoverformat</code>. </li> <li>Sets the y coordinate for single-box traces or the starting coordinate for multi-box traces set using q1/median/q3. See overview for more info. </li> <li>Sets the y sample data or coordinates. See overview for more info. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and a 2D cartesian y axis. If \"y\" (the default value), the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis</code>. If \"y2\", the y coordinates refer to <code>layout.yaxis2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>y</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format.

<code>colorscale</code>. In case <code>colorscale</code> is unspecified or <code>autocolorscale</code> is true, the default palette will be chosen according to whether numbers in the <code>color</code> array are all positive, all negative or mixed. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the <code>caps</code>. The default fill value of the <code>caps</code> is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the <code>slices</code>. The default fill value of the x <code>slices</code> is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the <code>caps</code>. The default fill value of the <code>caps</code> is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the <code>slices</code>. The default fill value of the y <code>slices</code> is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the <code>caps</code>. The default fill value of the <code>caps</code> is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the <code>slices</code>. The default fill value of the z <code>slices</code> is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the color domain is computed with respect to the input data (here <code>value</code>) or the bounds set in <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code> Defaults to <code>false</code> when <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code> are set by the user. </li> <li>Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as <code>value</code> and if set, <code>cmin</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling <code>cmin</code> and/or <code>cmax</code> to be equidistant to this point. Value should have the same units as <code>value</code>. Has no effect when <code>cauto</code> is <code>false</code>. </li> <li>Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should have the same units as <code>value</code> and if set, <code>cmax</code> must be set as well. </li> <li>Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to these shared color axes are \"coloraxis\", \"coloraxis2\", \"coloraxis3\", etc. Settings for these shared color axes are set in the layout, under <code>layout.coloraxis</code>, <code>layout.coloraxis2</code>, etc. Note that multiple color scales can be linked to the same color axis. </li> <li>Sets the color of padded area. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing this color bar. </li> <li>Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with <code>tick0</code>. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to \"log\" and \"date\" axes. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then ticks are set every 10^(n\"dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. \"log\" has several special values; \"L\", where <code>f</code> is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example <code>tick0</code> = 0.1, <code>dtick</code> = \"L0.5\" will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use \"D1\" (all digits) or \"D2\" (only 2 and 5). <code>tick0</code> is ignored for \"D1\" and \"D2\". If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set <code>dtick</code> to 86400000.0. \"date\" also has special values \"M\" gives ticks spaced by a number of months. <code>n</code> must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set <code>tick0</code> to \"2000-01-15\" and <code>dtick</code> to \"M3\". To set ticks every 4 years, set <code>dtick</code> to \"M48\"  <li>Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If \"none\", it appears as 1,000,000,000. If \"e\", 1e+9. If \"E\", 1E+9. If \"power\", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If \"SI\", 1G. If \"B\", 1B. </li> <li>Sets the length of the color bar This measure excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the color bar length is this length minus the padding on both ends. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's length (i.e. the measure in the color variation direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels. Use <code>len</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when <code>tickformat</code> is \"SI\" or \"B\". </li> <li>Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to <code>nticks</code>. Has an effect only if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"auto\". </li> <li>Sets the orientation of the colorbar. </li> <li>Sets the axis line color. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px) of the axis line. </li> <li>If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated </li> <li>If \"all\", all exponents are shown besides their significands. If \"first\", only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If \"last\", only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If \"none\", no exponents appear. </li> <li>Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn. </li> <li>If \"all\", all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If \"first\", only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If \"last\", only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If \"none\", tick prefixes are hidden. </li> <li>Same as <code>showtickprefix</code> but for tick suffixes. </li> <li>Sets the thickness of the color bar This measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks and labels. </li> <li>Determines whether this color bar's thickness (i.e. the measure in the constant color direction) is set in units of plot \"fraction\" or in \"pixels\". Use <code>thickness</code> to set the value. </li> <li>Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with <code>dtick</code>. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"log\", then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the <code>tick0</code> to 2) except when <code>dtick</code>=\"L\" (see <code>dtick</code> for more info). If the axis <code>type</code> is \"date\", it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis <code>type</code> is \"category\", it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.  <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically. </li> <li>Sets the tick color. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\" </li> <li>range [\"min\", \"max\"], where \"min\", \"max\" - dtick values which describe some zoom level, it is possible to omit \"min\" or \"max\" value by passing \"null\" </li> <li>Determines whether or not this stop is used. If <code>false</code>, this stop is ignored even within its <code>dtickrange</code>. </li> <li>When used in a template, named items are created in the output figure in addition to any items the figure already has in this array. You can modify these items in the output figure by making your own item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching this <code>name</code> alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). Has no effect outside of a template. </li> <li>Used to refer to a named item in this array in the template. Named items from the template will be created even without a matching item in the input figure, but you can modify one by making an item with <code>templateitemname</code> matching its <code>name</code>, alongside your modifications (including <code>visible: false</code> or <code>enabled: false</code> to hide it). If there is no template or no matching item, this item will be hidden unless you explicitly show it with <code>visible: true</code>. </li> <li>string - dtickformat for described zoom level, the same as \"tickformat\" </li> <li>Determines how we handle tick labels that would overflow either the graph div or the domain of the axis. The default value for inside tick labels is \"hide past domain\". In other cases the default is \"hide past div\". </li> <li>Determines where tick labels are drawn relative to the ticks. Left and right options are used when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\", top and bottom when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\". </li> <li>Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. <code>tick0</code> determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with <code>type</code> \"log\" or \"multicategory\", or when <code>tickmode</code> is \"array\". </li> <li>Sets the tick length (in px). </li> <li>Sets the tick mode for this axis. If \"auto\", the number of ticks is set via <code>nticks</code>. If \"linear\", the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position <code>tick0</code> and a tick step <code>dtick</code> (\"linear\" is the default value if <code>tick0</code> and <code>dtick</code> are provided). If \"array\", the placement of the ticks is set via <code>tickvals</code> and the tick text is <code>ticktext</code>. (\"array\" is the default value if <code>tickvals</code> is provided). </li> <li>Sets a tick label prefix. </li> <li>Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If \"\", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If \"outside\" (\"inside\"), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines. </li> <li>Sets a tick label suffix. </li> <li>Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via <code>tickvals</code>. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>tickvals</code>. </li> <li>Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if <code>tickmode</code> is set to \"array\". Used with <code>ticktext</code>. </li> <li>Sets the tick width (in px). </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system.

These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Determines the location of color bar's title with respect to the color bar. Defaults to \"top\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"v\" and defaults to \"right\" when <code>orientation</code> if \"h\". Note that the title's location used to be set by the now deprecated <code>titleside</code> attribute. </li> <li>Sets the title of the color bar. Note that before the existence of <code>title.text</code>, the title's contents used to be defined as the <code>title</code> attribute itself. This behavior has been deprecated. </li> <li>Sets the x position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's horizontal position anchor. This anchor binds the <code>x</code> position to the \"left\", \"center\" or \"right\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"left\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"center\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the x direction. </li> <li>Sets the y position of the color bar (in plot fraction). Defaults to 0.5 when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and 1.02 when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets this color bar's vertical position anchor This anchor binds the <code>y</code> position to the \"top\", \"middle\" or \"bottom\" of the color bar. Defaults to \"middle\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"v\" and \"bottom\" when <code>orientation</code> is \"h\". </li> <li>Sets the amount of padding (in px) along the y direction. </li> <li>Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]</code>. To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space, use <code>cmin</code> and <code>cmax</code>. Alternatively, <code>colorscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,Electric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,RdBu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd. </li> <li>Sets the color of the contour lines. </li> <li>Sets whether or not dynamic contours are shown on hover </li> <li>Sets the width of the contour lines. </li> <li>Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when listening to hover, click and selection events. Note that, \"scatter\" traces also appends customdata items in the markers DOM elements </li> <li>Determines whether or not normal smoothing is applied to the meshes, creating meshes with an angular, low-poly look via flat reflections. </li> <li>Determines which trace information appear on hover. If <code>none</code> or <code>skip</code> are set, no information is displayed upon hovering. But, if <code>none</code> is set, click and hover events are still fired. </li> <li>Sets the horizontal alignment of the text content within hover label box. Has an effect only if the hover label text spans more two or more lines </li> <li>Sets the background color of the hover labels for this trace </li> <li>Sets the border color of the hover labels for this trace. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the default length (in number of characters) of the trace name in the hover labels for all traces. -1 shows the whole name regardless of length. 0-3 shows the first 0-3 characters, and an integer &gt;3 will show the whole name if it is less than that many characters, but if it is longer, will truncate to <code>namelength - 3</code> characters and add an ellipsis. </li> <li>Template string used for rendering the information that appear on hover box. Note that this will override <code>hoverinfo</code>. Variables are inserted using %{variable}, for example \"y: %{y}\" as well as %{xother}, {%xother}, {%_xother}, {%xother_}. When showing info for several points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different x positions from the first point. An underscore before or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side, only when this field is shown. Numbers are formatted using d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are formatted using d3-time-format's syntax %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day: %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the date formatting syntax. The variables available in <code>hovertemplate</code> are the ones emitted as event data described at this link https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data. Additionally, every attributes that can be specified per-point (the ones that are <code>arrayOk: true</code>) are available. Anything contained in tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;</code> is displayed in the secondary box, for example \"{fullData.name}\". To hide the secondary box completely, use an empty tag <code>&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;</code>. </li> <li>Same as <code>text</code>. </li> <li>Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object constancy of data points during animation. Should be an array of strings, not numbers or any other type. </li> <li>Sets the maximum boundary for iso-surface plot. </li> <li>Sets the minimum boundary for iso-surface plot. </li> <li>Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of the same legend group hide/show at the same time when toggling legend items. </li> <li>HTML font family - the typeface that will be applied by the web browser. The web browser will only be able to apply a font if it is available on the system which it operates. Provide multiple font families, separated by commas, to indicate the preference in which to apply fonts if they aren't available on the system. The Chart Studio Cloud (at https://chart-studio.plotly.com or on-premise) generates images on a server, where only a select number of fonts are installed and supported. These include \"Arial\", \"Balto\", \"Courier New\", \"Droid Sans\",, \"Droid Serif\", \"Droid Sans Mono\", \"Gravitas One\", \"Old Standard TT\", \"Open Sans\", \"Overpass\", \"PT Sans Narrow\", \"Raleway\", \"Times New Roman\". </li> <li>Sets the title of the legend group. </li> <li>Sets the legend rank for this trace. Items and groups with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while with <code>\"reversed\"</code>legend.traceorder` they are on bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than 1000 to go after all unranked items. </li> <li>Sets the width (in px or fraction) of the legend for this trace. </li> <li>Ambient light increases overall color visibility but can wash out the image. </li> <li>Represents the extent that incident rays are reflected in a range of angles. </li> <li>Epsilon for face normals calculation avoids math issues arising from degenerate geometry. </li> <li>Represents the reflectance as a dependency of the viewing angle; e.g. paper is reflective when viewing it from the edge of the paper (almost 90 degrees), causing shine. </li> <li>Alters specular reflection; the rougher the surface, the wider and less contrasty the shine. </li> <li>Represents the level that incident rays are reflected in a single direction, causing shine. </li> <li>Epsilon for vertex normals calculation avoids math issues arising from degenerate geometry. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the X coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the Y coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Numeric vector, representing the Z coordinate for each vertex. </li> <li>Assigns extra meta information associated with this trace that can be used in various text attributes. Attributes such as trace <code>name</code>, graph, axis and colorbar <code>title.text</code>, annotation <code>text</code> <code>rangeselector</code>, <code>updatemenues</code> and <code>sliders</code> <code>label</code> text all support <code>meta</code>. To access the trace <code>meta</code> values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use <code>%{meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> item in question. To access trace <code>meta</code> in layout attributes, use <code>%{data[n[.meta[i]}</code> where <code>i</code> is the index or key of the <code>meta</code> and <code>n</code> is the trace index. </li> <li>Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in the case of using high <code>opacity</code> values for example a value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and 0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved in the near future and is subject to change. </li> <li>Sets the opacityscale. The opacityscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an opacity value. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example, <code>[[0, 1], [0.5, 0.2], [1, 1]]</code> means that higher/lower values would have higher opacity values and those in the middle would be more transparent Alternatively, <code>opacityscale</code> may be a palette name string of the following list: 'min', 'max', 'extremes' and 'uniform'. The default is 'uniform'. </li> <li>Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, <code>cmin</code> will correspond to the last color in the array and <code>cmax</code> will correspond to the first color. </li> <li>Sets a reference between this trace's 3D coordinate system and a 3D scene. If \"scene\" (the default value), the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to <code>layout.scene</code>. If \"scene2\", the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to <code>layout.scene2</code>, and so on. </li> <li>Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this trace is shown in the legend. </li> <li>Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for this trace. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the <code>slices</code>. The default fill value of the <code>slices</code> is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Specifies the location(s) of slices on the axis. When not specified slices would be created for all points of the axis x except start and end. </li> <li>Determines whether or not slice planes about the x dimension are drawn. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the <code>slices</code>. The default fill value of the <code>slices</code> is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Specifies the location(s) of slices on the axis. When not specified slices would be created for all points of the axis y except start and end. </li> <li>Determines whether or not slice planes about the y dimension are drawn. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the <code>slices</code>. The default fill value of the <code>slices</code> is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Specifies the location(s) of slices on the axis. When not specified slices would be created for all points of the axis z except start and end. </li> <li>Determines whether or not slice planes about the z dimension are drawn. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the <code>spaceframe</code> elements. The default fill value is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Displays/hides tetrahedron shapes between minimum and maximum iso-values. Often useful when either caps or surfaces are disabled or filled with values less than 1. </li> <li>Sets the number of iso-surfaces between minimum and maximum iso-values. By default this value is 2 meaning that only minimum and maximum surfaces would be drawn. </li> <li>Sets the fill ratio of the iso-surface. The default fill value of the surface is 1 meaning that they are entirely shaded. On the other hand Applying a <code>fill</code> ratio less than one would allow the creation of openings parallel to the edges. </li> <li>Sets the surface pattern of the iso-surface 3-D sections. The default pattern of the surface is <code>all</code> meaning that the rest of surface elements would be shaded. The check options (either 1 or 2) could be used to draw half of the squares on the surface. Using various combinations of capital <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code> and <code>E</code> may also be used to reduce the number of triangles on the iso-surfaces and creating other patterns of interest. </li> <li>Hides/displays surfaces between minimum and maximum iso-values. </li> <li>Sets the text elements associated with the vertices. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace: <code>constraintrange</code> in <code>parcoords</code> traces, as well as some <code>editable: true</code> modifications such as <code>name</code> and <code>colorbar.title</code>. Defaults to <code>layout.uirevision</code>. Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Sets the 4th dimension (value) of the vertices. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>value</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.By default the values are formatted using generic number format. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible). </li> <li>Sets the X coordinates of the vertices on X axis. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>x</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, \"2016-10-13 09:15:23.456\" with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would display \"09~15~23.46\"By default the values are formatted using <code>xaxis.hoverformat</code>. </li> <li>Sets the Y coordinates of the vertices on Y axis. </li> <li>Sets the hover text formatting rulefor <code>y</code> using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format.

If a single string, the same string appears over all the data points. If an array of string, the items are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates. If trace <code>hoverinfo</code> contains a \"text\" flag and \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in the hover labels. </li> <li>Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the bar. For example, a <code>tickangle</code> of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.

Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by <code>layout</code> attributes: <code>trace.visible</code> is controlled by <code>layout.legend.uirevision</code>, <code>selectedpoints</code> is controlled by <code>layout.selectionrevision</code>, and <code>colorbar.(x|y)</code> (accessible with <code>config: {editable: true}</code>) is controlled by <code>layout.editrevision</code>. Trace changes are tracked by <code>uid</code>, which only falls back on trace index if no <code>uid</code> is provided. So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the <code>data</code> array, such that the same trace has a different index, you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a <code>uid</code> that stays with it as it moves. </li> <li>Determines whether or not this trace is visible.

This means you have three separate databases, but they all used to run your application, so that is a single <code>target</code>.  The following might be how you set that up in your project:</p> <pre><code>targets:\n  - name: domain_target\n    database: app_db\n    type: postgresql\n    username:  {{ env_var('APP_DATABASE_USERNAME') }} \n    password:  {{ env_var('APP_DATABASE_USERNAME') }} \n</code></pre> <p>This structure then allows you to set your username and password per environment to connect to that environment's <code>app_db</code>.
