        === "Simple"

            ``` yaml
            targets:
              - name: sqlite_target
                database: local/file/local.db
                type: sqlite
            ```

        === "Additional Attached"
            Attaching other SQLite databases allows you to join models between databases.

            ``` yaml
            targets:
              - name: sqlite_target
                database: local/file/local.db
                type: sqlite
                attach:
                  - schema_name: static
                    name: static_target
                    database: local/static/file/local.db
                    type: sqlite
            ```

            The above target can be then used in a model and the sql for that model might look similar to: `SELECT * FROM local AS l JOIN static.data AS sd ON l.static_id=sd.id`
    {% endraw %}
