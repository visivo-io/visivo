## Overview

The `candlestick` trace type is commonly used in financial analysis to visualize the price movements of a stock or asset over time. It requires open, high, low, and close (OHLC) data and is useful for tracking the performance of a stock or identifying market trends.

You can control the appearance of candlestick charts through attributes such as `increasing`, `decreasing`, `line`, `fillcolor`, and more to highlight upward and downward trends in the market.
