## Overview

The `carpet` trace type is used to create carpet plots, which can be useful for visualizing data across irregular spaces or non-grid-like arrangements. Carpet plots are **commonly employed in complex datasets** that span two independent variables, such as pressure and temperature or other bivariate datasets.

Carpet traces provide you with control over the X and Y axes, as well as customization of the A and B axes (the independent variables). You can also use a variety of formatting options, including line, color, and axis ticks to enhance the visualization.

!!! tip "Common Uses"

    - **Distortion Analysis**: Visualizing data across irregular spaces, such as in physics or engineering.
    - **Bivariate Data Visualization**: Displaying complex relationships between two independent variables.
    - **Gridless Data Representation**: Visualizing data that doesn't fit neatly into grid-like structures.

_**Check out the [Attributes](../configuration/Trace/Props/Carpet/#attributes) for the full set of configuration options**_

        Here's a simple(ish) `carpet` plot showing data across two independent variables (A and B):

        You can copy this code below to create this chart in your project:

        ```yaml
        models:
          - name: carpet-data-axes
            args:
              - echo
              - |

                2,6,3,4
                3,7,4,5
                4,8,5,6
                5,9,6,7
        traces:
