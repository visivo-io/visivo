## Overview

The `ohlc` trace type is used to create OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) charts, which are commonly used to visualize stock market data or financial data over time. OHLC charts represent price movements for a given period using vertical bars for high and low prices, and tick marks for open and close prices.

You can customize the colors, bar widths, and date ranges to represent financial data effectively.

!!! tip "Common Uses"
    - **Stock Market Visualization**: Displaying price movement data for stocks, currencies, or commodities.
    - **Financial Time Series**: Visualizing price fluctuations over time.
    - **Trading Analysis**: Understanding market trends through candlestick-like visualizations.

    === "Simple OHLC Plot"

        Here's a simple `ohlc` plot showing the Open, High, Low, and Close prices of a stock over time:

        ![](../../assets/example-charts/props/ohlc/simple-ohlc.png)

        You can copy this code below to create this chart in your project:

        ```yaml
        models:
          - name: ohlc-data
            args:
              - echo
              - |
                date,open,high,low,close
                2023-01-01,100,105,95,102

                2023-01-04,109,112,107,111
                2023-01-05,111,114,110,113
        traces:
          - name: Simple OHLC Plot
            model: ref(ohlc-data)
            props:
              type: ohlc
              x: query(date)
              open: query(open)
              high: query(high)
              low: query(low)
              close: query(close)
              increasing:
                line:
                  color: "#17becf"
              decreasing:
                line:

        charts:

        ```

    === "OHLC Plot with Custom Bar Width"

        This example demonstrates an `ohlc` plot with custom bar widths to adjust the spacing between the OHLC bars:

        ![](../../assets/example-charts/props/ohlc/custom-width-ohlc.png)

        Here's the code:

        ```yaml
