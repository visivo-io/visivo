# Quick Start

## üöÄ Data to Dashboard in 90 Seconds

Transform your data into interactive dashboards with a single command. No configuration files, no complex setup‚Äîjust instant visualization.

### 1. Install Visivo

```bash
curl -fsSL https://visivo.sh | bash
```

!!! success "One command, all platforms"
    Our installation script handles macOS, Linux, and Windows automatically. If you have an unsupported environment, check out our [pip installation guide](installation.md#python-package-pip).

### 2. Start the Local Server

```bash
visivo serve
```

This single command gives you a complete environment in seconds!

### 3. Choose an Example

Visivo will prompt you to select from several example dashboards, then:

- Initialize the chosen example into your current directory
- Create a complete `project.visivo.yml` configuration file
- Load sample data and refresh your browser to show the new configuration

Each example includes:
- Pre-configured sample data
- Multiple chart types to explore
- Interactive filters and controls
- A complete configuration to learn from

### 4. Make It Your Own

The example dashboard is fully functional and editable:
- Open the generated `project.visivo.yml` in your editor
- Modify any part of the configuration
- Save and watch your changes appear instantly

!!! tip "What happens behind the scenes"
    When you run `visivo serve` without a config file, Visivo:
    
    1. Prompts you to choose from available examples
    2. Initializes the selected example into your directory
    3. Loads sample data into DuckDB
    4. Renders the dashboard with hot-reload enabled
    5. Opens your browser to show the result

Now jump to [Experience Live Development](#experience-live-development) to see the magic of instant updates!

## Experience Live Development

Once your dashboard is running (from either path), experience the magic of hot-reload. This is especially powerful when combined with Agent AI iteration:

### The Development Cycle

1. **:material-file-edit: Edit** - Open `project.visivo.yml` in your editor and make any change:
   
   ```yaml
   charts:
     - name: revenue_chart
       layout:
         title: Monthly Revenue  # ‚Üê Change this
   ```

2. **:material-content-save: Save** - Save the file (Cmd+S / Ctrl+S). That's it! No build command needed.

3. **:material-eye: See** - Your dashboard updates instantly in the browser.
   - ‚úÖ No compilation
   - ‚úÖ No build step  
   - ‚úÖ No page refresh

### Why This Matters

This instant feedback loop revolutionizes dashboard development:

- **Experiment Freely** - Try different visualizations instantly
- **Learn Faster** - See the impact of each change immediately  
- **Debug Visually** - Spot issues as they happen
- **Iterate Quickly** - From idea to implementation in seconds

!!! tip "Pro Tip: Split Screen Development"
    Open your editor and browser side-by-side. As you type and save, watch your dashboard transform in real-time. It's like having a conversation with your data!

## Alternative: AI-Powered Development

**Want a more conversational approach?** Try using AI agents like Claude Code to build your dashboard through natural language. AI can analyze your data, suggest visualizations, and write the complete configuration for you.
