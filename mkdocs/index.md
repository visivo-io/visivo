## Serve Path: Example Dashboard

The simplest way to get started‚Äîrun one command and explore a working dashboard!

### 1. Run the Command

```bash
visivo serve
```

### 2. Choose an Example

Visivo will prompt you to select from several example dashboards, then:

- Initialize the chosen example into your current directory
- Create a complete `project.visivo.yml` configuration file
- Load sample data and refresh your browser to show the new configuration

Each example includes:
- Pre-configured sample data
- Multiple chart types to explore
- Interactive filters and controls
- A complete configuration to learn from

### 3. Make It Your Own

The example dashboard is fully functional and editable:
- Open the generated `project.visivo.yml` in your editor
- Modify any part of the configuration
- Save and watch your changes appear instantly

!!! tip "What happens behind the scenes"
    When you run `visivo serve` without a config file, Visivo:
    
    1. Prompts you to choose from available examples
    2. Initializes the selected example into your directory
    3. Loads sample data into DuckDB
    4. Renders the dashboard with hot-reload enabled
    5. Opens your browser to show the result

## Agent AI Path: Build with Claude Code

Use the power of an AI Agent to iteratively create and refine your dashboard configuration through conversation.

### 1. Create Your Project Directory

```bash
mkdir my-dashboard
cd my-dashboard
```

### 2. Use This Prompt with Claude Code

Copy this prompt and paste it into Claude Code or similar AI Agent:

!!! example "Dashboard Generation Prompt"
    ```
    Create a Visivo dashboard from my data located here: [YOUR DATA HERE].
    
    Requirements:
    - Use DuckDB as the data source
    - Load data from either:
      * A CSV file I provide above, OR
      * This sample retail dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visivo-io/visivo/main/mkdocs/assets/us_land_use.csv
    - Analyze the data and create at least 3 different charts showing different insights
    - Read the docs at docs.visivo.io to know how Visivo works and create a project.visivo.yml
    - Validate the visivo configuration with `visivo run`.
    - If the data is a csv use Visivo's [CSVFileSource](https://docs.visivo.io/reference/configuration/Sources/CSVFileSource/) to load that data. 
    - Provide the complete project.visivo.yml file with inline comments explaining each section.
    ```

### 3. Iterate and Refine

Work with the AI Agent to save, test, and refine the configuration:

- Serve the dashboard with `visivo serve`
- Ask the Agent to modify charts, add features, or fix any issues
- Continue the conversation until your dashboard is perfect

### 4. Launch Your Dashboard

```bash
visivo serve
```

!!! success "Why Agent AI Works Better"
    AI Agents like Claude Code can read files, run commands, and iterate on solutions. This approach lets you:
    
    - Start with a working example tailored to your needs
    - Test and validate configurations automatically
    - Iterate quickly through conversation and feedback
    - Learn Visivo's syntax through guided exploration


Now jump to [Experience Live Development](#experience-live-development) to start customizing!

## Experience Live Development

Once your dashboard is running (from either path), experience the magic of hot-reload. This is especially powerful when combined with Agent AI iteration:

### The Development Cycle

1. **:material-file-edit: Edit** - Open `project.visivo.yml` in your editor and make any change:
   
   ```yaml
   charts:
     - name: revenue_chart
       layout:
         title: Monthly Revenue  # ‚Üê Change this
   ```

2. **:material-content-save: Save** - Save the file (Cmd+S / Ctrl+S). That's it! No build command needed.

3. **:material-eye: See** - Your dashboard updates instantly in the browser.
   - ‚úÖ No compilation
   - ‚úÖ No build step  
   - ‚úÖ No page refresh

<figure markdown>
  ![Live reload demonstration](assets/interactivity-example.gif)
  <figcaption>Every save triggers an instant update. Watch your dashboard evolve in real-time!</figcaption>
</figure>

### Why This Matters

This instant feedback loop revolutionizes dashboard development:

- **Experiment Freely** - Try different visualizations instantly
- **Learn Faster** - See the impact of each change immediately  
- **Debug Visually** - Spot issues as they happen
- **Iterate Quickly** - From idea to implementation in seconds

!!! tip "Pro Tip: Split Screen Development"
    Open your editor and browser side-by-side. As you type and save, watch your dashboard transform in real-time. It's like having a conversation with your data!
