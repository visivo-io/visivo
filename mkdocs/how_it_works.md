# How Visivo Works
When working with Visivo, all you have to do is write yaml configurations & CLI commands. Visivo handles everything else automatically so you and your team can focus on just the stuff that matters. While the example that we will go through here is not exactly how Visivo functions under the hood, it's a pretty nice approximation to give you an idea of how the sauce is made!

Say you have a model called `widget_sales` that looks like this: 

| widget           | quantity | completed_at |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Useful Widget    | 300      | 2023-01-01   |
| Useful Widget    | 250      | 2023-01-07   |
| Useful Widget    | 150      | 2023-01-08   |
| Expensive Widget | 900      | 2023-01-02   |
| Expensive Widget | 50       | 2023-01-03   |
| Expensive Widget | 50       | 2023-01-09   |

You can write a trace in any yml file directly your project. The trace can be just a few lines or more complex if you want to customize it. Here's an example of a fairly simple trace that builds on the `widget_sales` model: 

=== "Relational Db"

    ``` yaml title="project_dir/project.visivo.yml"
    models:
      - name: widget_sales
        sql: select * from widget_sales
    traces:
      - name: simple_trace
        model: ref('widget_sales')
        cohort_on: query( widget )
        props:
          x: query( date_trunc('week', completed_at) )
          y: query( sum(amount) )
          marker: 
            color: query( case sum(amount) > 200 then 'green' else 'blue' end )
            shape: square
          mode: 'lines'
    charts:
      - name: simple_chart
        traces:
          - ref('simple_trace')
        layout:
          - title: Widget Sales by Week
    ```
=== "dbt"

    ``` yaml title="project_dir/models/schema.yml" 
    traces:
      - name: simple_trace
        model: ref('widget_sales')
        cohort_on: query( widget )
        props:
          x: query( date_trunc('week', completed_at) )
          y: query( sum(amount) )
          marker: 
            color: query( case sum(amount) > 200 then 'green' else 'blue' end )
            shape: square
          mode: 'lines'
    charts:
      - name: simple_chart
        traces:
          - ref('simple_trace')
        layout:
          - title: Widget Sales by Week
    models:
      - name: widget_sales
        description: "A table containing widgets sales sourced from the CRM"
        columns:
          - name: widget
            description: The type of widget sold
            tests: 
              - not_null
          - name: quantity
            description: The number of widgets sold
          - name: completed_at
            description: Timestamp of when the transaction occurred
    ```
    Where the dbt model is defined like this:
    ``` sql title="project_dir/models/widget_sales.sql" 
    SELECT 
      widget, 
      quantity, 
      completed_at
    FROM {% raw %}{{ source('crm', 'sales_of_widgets') }}{% endraw %}
    ```

Using that context, Visivo will produce this query and store it in your target directory:
``` sql title="project_dir/target/traces/simple_trace/query.sql"
WITH 
sql as (
select * from widget_sales --context set to target.database & target.schema
)
select 
  widget as "cohort_on",
  date_trunc('week', completed_at) as "x", 
  sum(amount) as "y", 
  case sum(amount) > 300 then 'green' else 'blue' end as "marker.color"
from sql 
GROUP BY 
  "cohort_on",
  "x"
```
After small transformations on the output of the query you get this `data.json` which is stored in the target directly next to the query to enable debugging:
``` json title="project_dir/target/traces/simple_trace/data.json"
{
"Useful Widget": {
  "x": ["2023-01-01", "2023-01-08"],
  "y": [300, 400],
  "marker.color": ["blue", "green"]
  },
"Expensive Widget": {
  "x": ["2023-01-01", "2023-01-08"],
  "y": [950, 50],
  "marker.color": ["green", "blue"]
  }
}
```
Next Visivo generates the plotly chart configuration:
``` js title="project_dir/target/charts/simple_chart/chart.js"
...

var traces = [
  {
    name: "Useful Widget",
    x: data["Useful Widget"]["x"],
    y: data["Useful Widget"]["y"],
    marker: {
      color: data["Useful Widget"]["marker.color"],
      shape: "square"
    },
    mode: "lines"
  },
  {
    name: "Expensive Widget",
    x: data["Expensive Widget"]["x"],
    y: data["Expensive Widget"]["y"],
    marker: {
      color: data["Expensive Widget"]["marker.color"],
      shape: "square"
    },
    mode: "lines"
  },
]
var layout = {title: "Widget Sales by Week" }

Plotly.newPlot('aDiv', data, layout);
```
The compiled JS produces a chart! Now you can mix and match traces with the one we outlined here or deploy this chart to 1 or more dashboards without having to do any duplicate work.
